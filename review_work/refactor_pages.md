This mapping will follow the process outlined in the "Migrating OpenSPP Documentation to New Structure" guide, using the "Proposed OpenSPP Documentation Structure" as the target and considering the "OpenSPP Documentation Contributor Guidelines" for audience and purpose.

Here's the spreadsheet content in a markdown table format. Please note that assigning "Primary Purpose" and "Primary Audience" often involves interpretation based on file names and original locations. "Keep/Discard/Merge" is assumed "Keep" unless a specific merge or new location implies otherwise.

This table should provide a solid starting point for your migration planning. Remember that the "Primary Purpose" and "Primary Audience" are best guesses and should be validated during the content audit phase. The "New Location" column directly reflects the proposed new structure. Some files are marked for "Merge" or "Split" based on the new structure's organization.
