# Integrations

This section provides comprehensive guides for connecting OpenSPP with external systems, identity providers, and other digital public infrastructure components. These integrations are key to building a robust and interoperable social protection ecosystem.

In addition to the list to the ones listed below, we also have integration with OpenCRVS and OpenFN.

Here, you will find detailed instructions and best practices for:

- **Digital Convergence Initiative (DCI)**: Learn how to implement the DCI specification to enable seamless data exchange between OpenSPP and other registries, such as a Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) system.

- **eSignet**: Discover how to integrate eSignet as an identity provider, allowing users to authenticate into OpenSPP using their MOSIP-based digital identity.

- **OpenID Connect (OIDC)**: Follow our guide to configure Keycloak as an OIDC provider for OpenSPP, enabling single sign-on (SSO) for a secure and streamlined user authentication experience.
