   Administrator-driven approach for intake and registration (aka supply-driven approach or en masse registration approach)
       Approaches sometimes used to register groups of households to be assessed and considered for potential inclusion in one or more programs. Three key features characterize administrator-driven approaches: (1) the impetus for initiating the engagement is driven by administrators, not the people being registered (state ≥ people); (2) registration is usually carried out en masse (groups or cohorts of households); and (3) timing: the timetable for administrator-driven approaches is typically driven by financing and capacity, not by the timing or needs of specific households. See also on-demand approach.

   Appeals
       Grievances about the correctness of decisions made by the programs. It may be a simple administrative error by the program, or involve fundamental issues of eligibility and entitlement, which can involve misinterpretation of the law by program; refusal of benefit or service; miscalculation of entitlements; or wrong categorization of the potential beneficiaries.

   Assessment of needs and conditions
       Systematic processes for determining the needs and conditions of registered individuals, families, or households for the purposes of (1) determining potential eligibility for specific programs and/or (2) informing the determination of benefits and services that may be rendered by the programs.

   Authentication
       Process of establishing confidence that a person is who they claim to be. Digital authentication generally involves a person electronically presenting one or more “authentication factors” to “assert” their identity—that is, to prove that they are the same person to whom the identity or credential was originally issued.

       | 🇸🇦 المستفيد، المستفيدين

   Beneficiary operations management
       A stage along the social protection delivery chain that involves the activity of continuously engaging and collecting information from the field or other sources (such as other databases), which is then processed through a set of protocols, recorded, and used to make decisions. This simple pattern of engaging, collecting, processing, and deciding is the common thread that ties together the set of activities that occur continuously in the implementation of a program. Beneficiary operations management includes three main functions, which are implemented simultaneously: beneficiary data management, monitoring of conditionalities, and implementation of a mechanism for the redress of grievances.

       | 🇫🇷 Gestion des opérations des bénéficiaires
       | 🇪🇸 Gestión de las operaciones de los beneficiarios
       | 🇸🇦 إدارة عمليات المستفيدين

   Beneficiary registry
       A database of beneficiaries of a social protection program. It is also a component of the beneficiary operations management system. These beneficiary registries contain information on program beneficiaries. Registries that contain information on beneficiaries of multiple programs are known as integrated beneficiary registries.

       | 🇫🇷 Registre des bénéficiaires
       | 🇪🇸 Registro de beneficiarios
       | 🇸🇦 سجل المستفيدين

   Benefits
       Something tangible that is given by social protection programs to individuals, families, or households. They may be in the form of cash transfers or in-kind (such as food stamps, food rations, and subsidies). They may be noncontributory social assistance programs that are financed by general revenues, or they may be financed by direct contributions as a form of social insurance.

       | 🇫🇷 Prestations
       | 🇪🇸 Beneficios
       | 🇸🇦 فوائد

       | 🇪🇸 Biometría o datos biométricos
       | 🇸🇦  القياسات الحيوية/يانات القياس الحيوي

   Biometric identification
       Process of searching against a biometric enrollment database to find and return the biometric reference identifier(s) attributable to a single individual. The comparison may be either a one-to-one (1:1) matching—commonly referred to as “biometric verification”—where comparison is done against a single template, or one-to-many (1:N) matching, where comparison is done against multiple templates.

   Case management
       The term "case management" is particularly problematic as it is used differently by various professions (for example, by social workers, health care workers, and IT specialists). Further, some may use the term “case management” to mean what we call beneficiary operations management. Some practitioners use the term case management to mean social work (covering awareness, intermediation, referrals, and counseling). Others use the term to refer to an integrated approach to managing clients all along the delivery chain (through the entire “life of the case,” as some practitioners call it). To avoid confusion, we avoid the term.

       | 🇫🇷 Gestion des cas
       | 🇪🇸 Gestión social individualizada
       | 🇸🇦 إدارة الحالات

   Cash transfers
       Money distributed to individuals, families, or households. Cash transfers are direct, regular, and predictable noncontributory cash payments that help beneficiaries to raise and smooth incomes.

   Census-sweep registration method
       Mass registration of households into the social registry. With the census sweep approach, all or most households in specific areas (or the entire country) are registered en masse. In contrast to the on-demand approach (see below), with the census-sweep approach, enumerator teams go to the communities and conduct intake and registration using door-to-door methods.

       | 🇸🇦 رصد الشروط

   Conditionalities monitoring cycle
       The recurring period that begins with the latest roster of beneficiary households, with information on pertinent family members (inputs), and ends with a revised beneficiary roster that updates with information on compliance for that cycle, as well as any decisions on consequences for noncompliance (outputs), which would link back to the payroll for the next payment cycle (outputs). The conditionalities monitoring cycle includes both the compliance period and the compliance verification period.

   Data integration
       Combines data from different sources and provides users with a unified view of these data for service integration. When services are provided by multiple suppliers, the service integration challenge is to seamlessly integrate them into end-to-end services that operate as a single IT service delivery model.

       | 🇪🇸 Cadena de implementación
       | 🇸🇦 سلسلة التوصيل

   Delivery chain process mapping
       A management tool for mapping the sequencing of implementation processes across actors (institutions) or levels of government. Important for establishing uniqueness and clarity of roles, and useful for mapping the “as-is” processes and potential “to-be” vision for reforms.

   Designated recipient
       The individual in the beneficiary family or household who is designated as the grantee or recipient of benefits when they are paid out (for authentication and payment purposes). A designated recipient should be named for all benefits for which the assistance unit is a group (family or household). A designated recipient may also be needed for individual-based benefits if the beneficiary requires some guardian to act on their behalf (such as with orphans or severely disabled individuals).

       | 🇫🇷 Récipiendaire désigné
       | 🇪🇸 Destinatario designado
       | 🇸🇦 المستلم المعين

   Disabled
       Persons with disabilities include those who have long-term physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory impairments which, in interaction with various barriers, may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others (International Labour Organization). An individual with a disability is defined as a person who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities; (2) has a record of such an impairment; or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment.

   Effectiveness
       It is central to the performance of delivery systems. As defined by the OECD/DAC (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Develelopment/Development Assistance Committee) evaluation criteria, effectiveness is a measure of the extent to which a program or activity attains its objective. In this Sourcebook, an effective system is not only one that reaches, registers, and provides benefits and services to most of the intended population, but is also a system that is inclusive because it accommodates the specific needs of vulnerable populations and those who face access barriers. Consequently, the evaluation criterion of inclusion is embedded within effectiveness to reflect this logic.

       | 🇫🇷 Efficacité
       | 🇪🇸 Eficacia
       | 🇸🇦 فعالية

   Efficiency
       Another important dimension of the performance of delivery systems, albeit one that is difficult to measure. Ensuring that outcomes are achieved at reasonable costs, including moving clients through the various phases of the delivery chain at minimal cost in terms of time and money both for administrators and clients, is critical to evaluating performance. Alternative measures of efficiency include processing times for various phases or stages along the delivery chain.

   Foundational identification system
       A system for proving (or “authenticating”) an individual’s unique identity. It uses a minimal set of attributes, such as biographic and biometric data, to exclusively describe an individual and, on that basis, to provide government-recognized identity credentials. It is “foundational” relative to various functional systems and databases (e.g., education, health) on which it relies, but it is a parallel and complementary component (along with, for instance, the civil registration system) of the larger ecosystem.

       | 🇫🇷 Système d'identification fondamental

       | 🇸🇦 برامج الحد الأدنى المضمون للدخل (GMI)

   Hard-to-serve individuals or families
       In general, hard-to-serve individuals or families face multiple risks and constraints, and the complexity that arises with that multiplicity makes it hard to serve them with labor and social services, requiring coordinated or integrated service approaches to help them reduce their social risks and narrow their distance to the labor market.
