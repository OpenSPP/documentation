# API

## Odoo API

Odoo is providing a [generic API](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/15.0/developer/api/external_api.html)
based on [XML-RPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML-RPC) for all the models in the systems. This API can be
used to import or export any data into the system.

## REST API

The REST API is currently being reworked.
