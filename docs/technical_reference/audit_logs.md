# Audit Logs

The ability to audit the actions performed by users is a key feature of OpenSPP. It allows to track the
changes made to the system and to the data stored in the system. It is also part of the architecture
priniciples of OpenSPP.

We recommend using the [Audit Trail by Smile](https://apps.odoo.com/apps/modules/15.0/smile_audit/) module.

## Installing

Smile Audit installed using the technical name `smile_audit`

## Configuration

After installation, the administrator can configure the audit rules required by the specific OpenSPP
implementation. Detailed configuration instructions are available in the
[Smile Audit documentation](https://apps.odoo.com/apps/modules/15.0/smile_audit/).
