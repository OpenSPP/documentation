# Products

OpenSPP offers three product configurations, each designed for specific social protection use cases. Choose the one that matches your program's needs.

## Available configurations

### [SP-MIS](sp_mis.md)

### [Social Registry](social_registry.md)  
Centralized database of individuals and households that serves multiple social programs. Provides a single source of truth across interventions, reducing duplication and improving coordination between programs.

### [Farmer Registry](farmer_registry.md)
Specialized registry for agricultural programs that bridges farming and social protection. Enables targeted agricultural interventions, input distribution, and climate-smart agriculture support for rural communities.
