# From proof of concept to pilot

Implementing OpenSPP progresses through four key phases: Proof of Concept, Pilot, Scale-up, and Operational Support. This guide focuses on the first two phases, providing insights into the PoC and Pilot stages. The PoC, typically lasting 4-8 weeks, demonstrates OpenSPP's core capabilities and adaptability to specific needs. The Pilot, spanning 3-6 months, involves a small-scale but real-world implementation to test feasibility, effectiveness, and scalability. This document provides a comprehensive overview of both phases, including their purposes, key components, and success criteria.

## Proof of Concept (PoC)

A PoC serves as the initial step in exploring OpenSPP's potential within a specific context, typically lasting 4-8 weeks. It involves a basic OpenSPP configuration with customization of Aone key feature, deployed in either a cloud or on-premise environment. The PoC uses mock data and does not include integrations with existing systems, allowing for a focused evaluation of core capabilities.

The PoC process begins with an initial workshop lasting 1-2 days, where project scope and objectives are defined, the key feature for customization is identified, and stakeholder expectations are aligned. This is followed by a 3-6 week implementation and internal testing period. The PoC concludes with a demonstration event where the configured system is showcased, stakeholder feedback is collected, and potential areas for development are discussed.

Key outputs of the PoC include a configured OpenSPP instance with one customized feature, a high-level analysis document outlining findings, an initial list of requirements for further development, and a preliminary plan for a more comprehensive pilot.

Success criteria for the PoC include successful demonstration of core OpenSPP capabilities in the specific use case, positive stakeholder feedback on the customized feature, clear identification of potential benefits and challenges, alignment with initial project objectives, and a feasibility assessment for moving to the Pilot phase.

### Prerequisites and considerations

Before initiating a Proof of Concept, consider the following factors:

1. **Stakeholder engagement:** Identify and engage key stakeholders who will be involved in decision-making for the PoC. This typically includes project sponsors, potential end-users, and technical team members.

2. **Clear objectives:** Define specific, measurable objectives for the PoC. What key feature or capability of OpenSPP do you want to demonstrate?

3. **Resource allocation:** For the duration of the PoC, assign a small, focused team (typically 3-5 people) and ensure they have the necessary time and resources to dedicate to this short-term project.

4. **Data considerations:** Determine what mock data will be used for the PoC. Ensure it's representative of real scenarios without using actual sensitive information. Using mock data rather than live data reduces the need to focus attention on data privacy and security.

5. **Technical environment:** Decide whether the PoC will be deployed in a cloud or on-premise environment. Ensure the necessary infrastructure is available.

6. **Evaluation criteria:** Establish clear criteria for evaluating the PoC's success. This will help decide whether to proceed to a Pilot phase.

## Pilot implementation

A Pilot represents a small-scale but real-world implementation of OpenSPP, typically spanning 3-6 months. It involves comprehensive business analysis, multiple feature customizations, integrations with existing systems, and the use of real data with appropriate protections. The Pilot also includes change management, training, and the establishment of a monitoring and evaluation framework.

The Pilot phase encompasses several core workstreams: Business Analysis, Product Development and Testing, Integrations, Change Management and Training, Monitoring and Evaluation, and Operational Support.

The process begins with a four-day kickoff workshop for in-depth requirements gathering, detailed process mapping, and integration planning. This is followed by a 2-5 month implementation of core workstreams, 2-4 weeks of user acceptance testing, and 2-4 weeks of evaluation and next steps planning.

Success criteria for the Pilot include system uptime and reliability, user adoption rates, data accuracy and completeness, process efficiency improvements, and beneficiary satisfaction.

### Prerequisites and considerations

Before moving to the Pilot phase, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1. **Stakeholder commitment:** Secure firm commitment from a broader range of stakeholders, including higher-level decision-makers, for a more extensive implementation.

2. **Comprehensive objectives:** Develop a detailed set of objectives for the Pilot, covering multiple features and integration points.

3. **Resource planning:** Assemble a larger team (typically 8-12 people) with diverse skills. This includes roles such as project manager, developer, business analyst, and change management specialist.

4. **Data privacy and security:** Establish robust data protection measures for handling real beneficiary data and ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations.

5. **Integration strategy:** Develop a clear plan for integrating OpenSPP with existing systems. Identify which systems will be involved and how data will flow between them.

6. **Change management:** Prepare a change management and training strategy for users who will be involved in the Pilot.

7. **Monitoring and evaluation framework:** Develop a comprehensive framework for monitoring the Pilot's progress and evaluating its success.

8. **Scalability considerations:** Begin thinking about how the Pilot implementation could scale to a full deployment if successful.

## Comparison of PoC and pilot phases

| Aspect | Proof of Concept | Pilot |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Duration | 4-8 weeks | 3-6 months |
| Scope | Limited, focus on one key feature | Comprehensive, multiple features |
| Data used | Mock data | Real data |
| System integration | No integrations | Integrations with existing systems |
| User involvement | Limited, mainly for feedback | Extensive, including training |
| Outcome | Demonstration of potential | Real-world feasibility assessment |

## Next steps

Based on the outcomes of the PoC or Pilot, different paths can be taken. For a successful PoC, the next step would be to proceed to the Pilot phase. A successful Pilot would lead to planning for full-scale implementation. If challenges arise during either phase, it may be necessary to reassess, make adjustments, or explore alternatives.

## Estimated resource requirements

For a Proof of Concept, a team of 3-5 people is typically required, including roles such as Project Manager, developer, Business Analyst, and stakeholder representative. A pilot, being more comprehensive, usually requires a larger team of 8-12 people, with roles including Project Manager, multiple developers, Business Analysts, an Integration Specialist, a Change Management Specialist, a trainer, support staff, and stakeholder representatives.

## Frequently asked questions

### When should we choose a PoC over a pilot?

Choose a PoC when you need to quickly validate OpenSPP's potential in your context with minimal investment. Choose a Pilot when you're ready for a more comprehensive, real-world test of the system.

### Can we skip the PoC and go directly to a pilot?

While possible, it's generally recommended to start with a PoC to minimize risks and ensure alignment before committing to a more resource-intensive Pilot.

### How do we decide to move from PoC to pilot?

The decision should be based on the PoC's success criteria, stakeholder feedback, and an assessment of readiness for a larger-scale implementation.

### What if the PoC or pilot doesn't meet our expectations?

Use the insights gained to reassess your needs, adjust the implementation approach, or explore alternative solutions. Failure to meet expectations can provide valuable learnings for future efforts.

### How much customization should we expect during the PoC and pilot phases?

The PoC typically involves minimal customization (one key feature), while the Pilot allows for more extensive customization to meet specific needs.

### What are the main differences between a PoC and a pilot?

The main differences lie in duration, scope, data used, system integration, and user involvement. A PoC is shorter (4-8 weeks) with a limited scope, uses mock data, and has no system integrations. A Pilot is longer (3-6 months), more comprehensive, uses real data, includes system integrations, and involves extensive user training and involvement.

### How long does each phase typically last?

A PoC typically lasts 4-8 weeks, while a Pilot usually spans 3-6 months.

### What kind of team do we need for each phase?

A PoC usually requires a smaller team of 3-5 people, including a Project Manager, Developer, Business Analyst, and Stakeholder Representative. A Pilot needs a larger team of 8-12 people, with additional roles such as multiple Developers, Integration Specialist, Change Management Specialist, Trainer, and Support Staff.

### How do we measure the success of a PoC or pilot?

Success is measured against predefined criteria. For a PoC, this includes demonstrating core capabilities, receiving positive stakeholder feedback, and aligning with project objectives. For a Pilot, criteria often include system uptime, user adoption rates, data accuracy, process efficiency improvements, and beneficiary satisfaction.

### What happens after a successful pilot?

After a successful Pilot, the next step is typically planning for a full-scale implementation of OpenSPP across the intended scope of your social protection program.
