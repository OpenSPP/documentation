# Concepts

These concepts explain the theoretical foundations and design principles behind OpenSPP. Understanding them helps you make better decisions about implementation and customization.

## Architecture and design

**Digital public infrastructure**

{doc}`Digital public infrastructure <digital_public_infrastructure>`
Essential components of DPI and how OpenSPP aligns with DPI principles through modular, interoperable architecture.

**Integrated beneficiary registry**

{doc}`Integrated beneficiary registry <integrated_beneficiary_registry>`
Key components of an IBR, its advantages, and its relationship with social registries.

**Extensibility**

{doc}`Extensibility <extensibility>`
How OpenSPP's Odoo foundation enables customization through modular architecture and inheritance.

## Data management

**Registry key concepts**

{doc}`Registry key concepts <registry_key_concepts>`
Best practices for organizing data with a minimalistic approach and the four main registry structure components.

**Registrant concepts**

{doc}`Registrant concepts <registrant_concepts>`
Core terminology for individuals, groups, group memberships, and their relationships.

**Data collection and validation**

{doc}`Data collection and validation <data_collection_validation>`
Data minimization, user consent, versatile input methods, and validation processes.

## Security and governance

**Data protection**

{doc}`Data protection <data_protection>`
Principles of lawfulness, data minimization, and accountability within DPI context.
