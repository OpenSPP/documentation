# Register new individual

## Introduction

To integrate new individual information into the system and store it in the registry. A registrant becomes a beneficiary only after enrollment in a social protection program. The registration process is a critical component in the efficient administration of social protection, utilizing the recorded information to identify individuals, evaluate their needs, confirm their eligibility for social protection programs and other social services, and accurately determine benefit amounts. Initiatives for mass registration may occur at the start of a new program or during the creation of a new registry. Furthermore, new applicants can be added to existing programs or registries continuously.
