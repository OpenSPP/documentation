# Vulnerability scoring

Vulnerability scoring is commonly used in shock-responsive social protection (for example disasters, price shocks, public
health emergencies). It ranks or classifies registrants based on risk factors so programs can prioritize assistance.

In OpenSPP, vulnerability scoring is configured using the {doc}`scoring_framework` (the `spp_scoring` module).

## Recommended approach

1. Create a **Scoring Model** with:
   - **Category**: *Vulnerability Assessment*
   - **Calculation Method**: *Weighted Sum* (typical)
2. Add indicators for the risk factors your program uses.
3. Define thresholds for classifications (for example `HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, `LOW`) or vulnerability bands.
4. Activate the model and run scoring.

## Common indicator examples

The exact indicators depend on your data model. Typical inputs include:

- Household composition (elderly members, children under 5)
- Disability status
- Recent displacement or loss of housing
- Livelihood disruption
- Geographic exposure (hazard-prone area)

If a risk factor is not stored as a single field, compute it with a **CEL Formula** indicator (or store it as a computed
field in your registry) and score that output. For most deployments, it is better to define the intermediate logic as a
shared **variable** in Studio and then reuse it in the scoring model and elsewhere (Programs, validations, workflows).
