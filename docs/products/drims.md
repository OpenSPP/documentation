# OpenSPP DRIMS
*A digital system to manage the full lifecycle of social protection programs*

The **OpenSPP Disaster Response Inventory Management (DRIMS)** manages the complete lifecycle of emergency supplies, supporting donation tracking, request approvals, dispatch management, real-time inventory visibility, stock monitoring, and inter-agency coordination during disaster response.

## Key features

**Donation and supply management** – Track pledged and received supplies from UN agencies, NGOs, governments, and private donors. Manage inspection, lot tracking, and expiry monitoring to ensure safe and accountable stock handling.

**Multi-tier request and dispatch workflows** – Support structured approval workflows for relief requests from field teams. Manage picking, packing, waybill generation, and proof of delivery to ensure supplies reach affected populations efficiently.

**Real-time inventory visibility** – Monitor stock levels across central, regional, and mobile warehouses. Use dashboards and automated alerts to detect low stock levels, expiring items, and fulfillment delays.

**Cluster-based humanitarian coordination** – Tag requests, supplies, and personnel by OCHA/IASC humanitarian clusters (e.g., Food Security, Health, WASH, Shelter). Enable sector-specific reporting, gap analysis, and 4W (Who does What, Where, When) reporting for coordination meetings.

**Monitoring, audit, and accountability** – Maintain full audit trails of all operations. Track service-level agreements (SLAs), generate incident-based reporting, and ensure transparency across all disaster response workflows.

**Personnel and role management** – Manage deployed disaster response staff by role, cluster assignment, organization, and location. Enforce role-based access control to protect sensitive data and operational integrity.

## Who is it for?

**Government agencies** coordinating national emergency operations

**Humanitarian organizations** managing relief coordination

**NGOs and implementing partners** delivering emergency supplies

**Warehouse and logistics teams** managing disaster inventory
