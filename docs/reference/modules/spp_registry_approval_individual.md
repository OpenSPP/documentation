# OpenSPP Registry Approval Individual

The OpenSPP Registry Approval Individual module extends the core registry approval framework to specifically manage the validation and official approval of individual registrants. It provides the dedicated interface and processes for reviewing, verifying, and formally approving or rejecting individual profiles within the OpenSPP system.

## Purpose

This module enables a structured and robust approval process for individual registrant data, ensuring that all personal information is thoroughly reviewed and meets program requirements before an individual becomes eligible for social protection programs or other services.

*   **Formal Individual Approval Workflow**: Establishes a dedicated workflow for reviewing and validating individual registrant data, moving each profile through defined stages like Draft, Approved, or Rejected. This ensures all individual entries meet established criteria.
*   **Individual Data Integrity and Compliance**: Acts as a critical checkpoint to verify the accuracy and completeness of personal information, such as names, dates of birth, national IDs, and addresses, preventing unverified or non-compliant data from being used.
*   **Eligibility Determination for Individuals**: Facilitates the official confirmation of an individual's eligibility for specific social protection programs by providing a clear approval status based on verified data.
*   **Streamlined Individual Onboarding**: Enables efficient processing of individual applicants by providing clear actions for approval or rejection, reducing manual errors and accelerating the transition from application to program participation.
*   **Accountability and Audit Trail**: Records all approval and rejection decisions for individual registrants, creating an auditable history of changes and decisions made on each person's profile.

## Dependencies and Integration

This module is a direct extension of the [OpenSPP Registry Approval](spp_registry_approval) module, which provides the foundational framework for managing approval states across all registrant types. The `spp_registry_approval_individual` module specifically applies this general approval logic and associated user interface elements to individual registrant records.

By providing officially approved individual records, this module serves as a critical upstream component for other program-specific modules. It ensures that only validated and eligible individuals are made available for enrollment in social protection programs, benefit distribution, or further processing across the OpenSPP platform.

## Additional Functionality

### Dedicated Individual Profile Review

Users can access and review individual registrant profiles with the added context of their approval status. This view consolidates all relevant personal data, allowing validators to make informed decisions regarding an individual's eligibility and data accuracy.

### Application of Approval Status to Individuals

The module allows authorized personnel to directly change the approval state of an individual registrant. This includes transitioning an individual from a 'Draft' state to 'Approved' once their data is verified and criteria are met, or marking them as 'Rejected' if they do not qualify or have invalid information.

### Individual Data Validation and Verification

While the core data is managed elsewhere, this module provides the crucial step where individual-specific details are confirmed. This includes cross-referencing identification documents, verifying family relationships, and ensuring geographical data (e.g., country > province > district) is accurate for each person.

### History and Decision Tracking for Individuals

Every change in an individual's approval status, along with who made the decision and when, is automatically logged. This creates a transparent audit trail for each registrant, crucial for accountability and future reference in program management or dispute resolution.

## Conclusion

The OpenSPP Registry Approval Individual module is essential for formally validating and managing the eligibility status of individual registrants, ensuring accurate and reliable data for social protection programs.
