# OpenSPP Auto Update Entitlements

The OpenSPP Auto Update Entitlements module automatically reviews and updates the state of entitlements based on their redemption status at the end of each program cycle. This ensures that all benefits accurately reflect their final disposition, whether fully redeemed, partially redeemed, or unredeemed.

## Purpose

This module provides critical automation to maintain accurate entitlement records, supporting efficient program management and financial accountability. It accomplishes the following:

*   **Automates Entitlement Status Updates**: Automatically reviews all entitlements within a program cycle upon its conclusion and updates their states based on recorded transactions.
*   **Facilitates Program Cycle Closure**: Ensures that program cycles are properly closed with all associated entitlements reflecting their final redemption status, streamlining end-of-cycle processes.
*   **Accurately Tracks Redemption Progress**: Calculates and assigns precise states to entitlements, clearly indicating if they have been fully redeemed, partially redeemed, or remain unredeemed.
*   **Enhances Reporting and Auditing**: Provides up-to-date and accurate entitlement statuses, which are essential for generating reliable program reports, performing financial reconciliation, and supporting audits.
*   **Introduces a "Partially Redeemed" State**: Adds a specific status to clearly identify entitlements where only a portion of the benefit has been utilized.

## Dependencies and Integration

The OpenSPP Auto Update Entitlements module integrates seamlessly with core OpenSPP components to perform its functions:

*   **[G2P Programs](g2p_programs)**: This module builds upon the foundational framework provided by G2P Programs for defining social protection programs, managing their cycles, and generating entitlements. It extends the core cycle management to incorporate automated entitlement status updates at cycle end.
*   **[OpenSPP Programs](spp_programs)**: Leveraging the extensions from OpenSPP Programs, this module ensures that its automated updates apply consistently to both cash and in-kind entitlements managed within the system.
*   **[OpenSPP Entitlement Transactions](spp_ent_trans)**: This module relies heavily on the detailed transaction records from OpenSPP Entitlement Transactions. It uses this data to calculate the redeemed amounts and determine the final balance of each entitlement, which dictates its updated state.

## Additional Functionality

This module introduces key automated processes and status definitions that streamline the management of social protection benefits:

### Automated Cycle End Processing
When a program cycle reaches its designated end date, the system automatically triggers a comprehensive review of all entitlements linked to that cycle. Once all entitlements have been processed and their states updated, the module marks the entire program cycle as 'Ended', ensuring a clear and definitive close to the program period.

### Dynamic Entitlement Status Assignment
The module dynamically updates the status of each entitlement by comparing its initial allocated amount against the total amount redeemed through recorded transactions. It calculates the remaining `entitlement_balance`, which is then used to determine the appropriate new state.

### New "Partially Redeemed" State
A specific new state, "Partially Redeemed/Paid to Beneficiary," is introduced to provide granular tracking of benefit utilization. This state is assigned when a beneficiary has redeemed a portion of their entitlement, but a remaining balance still exists.

### Full Redemption Confirmation
For entitlements where the entire allocated amount has been redeemed, meaning the `entitlement_balance` is zero, the module automatically updates their status to "Redeemed/Paid to Beneficiary." This ensures that fully utilized benefits are clearly marked, providing an accurate overview of benefit disbursement.

## Conclusion

The OpenSPP Auto Update Entitlements module plays a crucial role in OpenSPP by automating the accurate reflection of entitlement redemption statuses at the close of program cycles, thereby ensuring data integrity and supporting robust program accountability.
