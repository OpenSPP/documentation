# Base Demo

The OpenSPP Base Demo module populates the OpenSPP system with essential sample data, enabling users to immediately explore and understand the platform's core functionalities. It provides a pre-configured environment for training, demonstrations, and initial system familiarization without requiring manual data entry.

## Purpose

This module significantly accelerates the onboarding process and user understanding by:

*   **Facilitating System Exploration**: Users can instantly navigate and interact with a fully populated OpenSPP environment, understanding how different components connect. This allows for hands-on learning from the moment the system is installed.
*   **Supporting User Training**: It provides a consistent and realistic dataset for training new staff or volunteers on OpenSPP's features, such as managing registrants or enrolling them in programs. This ensures all trainees work with the same information.
*   **Providing Realistic Data Examples**: The module includes diverse sample registrants, social protection programs, and products. This helps users visualize how real-world scenarios are managed within the system.
*   **Enabling Feature Testing**: Developers and administrators can use the pre-existing data to quickly test new configurations, module integrations, or custom developments without impacting live data. This creates a safe sandbox for experimentation.
*   **Demonstrating Core Workflows**: It allows for clear demonstrations of key OpenSPP workflows, such as registering an individual, assessing eligibility, or distributing benefits. This makes it easier to showcase the system's capabilities.

## Dependencies and Integration

The `spp_base_demo` module primarily serves to populate data for other modules rather than introducing new features itself.

It relies on the **[G2P Registry Individual](g2p_registry_individual)** module to define the structure for individual registrant data. The demo module then provides sample individual profiles, including names, birthdates, and genders, that conform to the data models established by the G2P Registry Individual module. This integration ensures that the demo data is relevant and functional within the core registry.

Additionally, this module provides foundational demo data for other OpenSPP modules that manage programs, products, and user roles. By populating these core entities, it ensures that subsequent modules have a rich dataset to operate on during demonstrations and training.

## Additional Functionality

While the `spp_base_demo` module does not introduce new user interfaces or business logic, its "functionality" lies in the comprehensive set of demonstration data it provides, enabling users to experience OpenSPP's capabilities:

### Sample Registrant Profiles

The module populates the system with a diverse set of individual registrant records. These sample profiles include varied names, birthdates (some approximate), and gender types, demonstrating the flexible data capture capabilities of the [G2P Registry Individual](g2p_registry_individual) module. Users can explore how individual details are recorded and managed, including age calculation and birthdate validations.

### Demonstration Program and Product Data

It includes sample social protection programs and associated products. This allows users to see how different program types are configured and how specific benefits (products) are linked to them. Users can then practice enrolling the sample registrants into these programs and observe the impact on their profiles.

### Geographic and User Data

The module sets up basic demonstration data for geographic hierarchies (e.g., country > province > district) and sample user accounts. This enables users to understand how geographic targeting works and how different user roles and permissions operate within the OpenSPP system. It also populates the system with defined gender types, which are then available for selection in individual profiles.

## Conclusion

The OpenSPP Base Demo module is crucial for accelerating user onboarding and system exploration by providing a complete, ready-to-use dataset, enabling immediate engagement with OpenSPP's core functionalities.
