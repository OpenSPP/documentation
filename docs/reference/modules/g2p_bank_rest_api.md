This module extends the REST API functionalities of the OpenSPP system by providing endpoints specifically for managing bank details related to beneficiaries and/or programs. 

**Purpose:**

The primary purpose of the [g2p_bank_rest_api](g2p_bank_rest_api) module is to expose bank-related data and operations through a standardized RESTful interface. This allows external systems, such as financial institutions or payment gateways, to interact with the OpenSPP platform and access or modify bank information. 

**Integration and Functionality:**

This module builds upon the core functionalities provided by the following modules:

- **[g2p_registry_rest_api](g2p_registry_rest_api):**  It leverages the base REST API infrastructure and authentication mechanisms provided by this module.
- **[g2p_bank](g2p_bank):** This module depends on the data models and business logic related to bank details, which are defined and managed by the [g2p_bank](g2p_bank) module.

**Additional Functionality:**

The [g2p_bank_rest_api](g2p_bank_rest_api) module introduces the following specific functionalities:

- **API Endpoints:**  It defines and implements REST API endpoints for operations such as:
    - Retrieving bank details for a specific beneficiary or program.
    - Updating bank information.
    - Potentially, verifying bank account details through integration with external services (depending on implementation).

**Example Use Case:**

Consider a scenario where a payment gateway needs to access the bank account details of a beneficiary to process a payment. The [g2p_bank_rest_api](g2p_bank_rest_api) module enables this by providing a secure and standardized API endpoint. The payment gateway can send a request to this endpoint with the necessary authentication and beneficiary identifiers, and the module would return the required bank information in a structured format (e.g., JSON).

**Note:** This documentation provides a general overview. Specific API endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication mechanisms are detailed in the API documentation generated by the [g2p_registry_rest_api](g2p_registry_rest_api) module.
