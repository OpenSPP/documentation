# Support Model

A three-tier support model is offered for the product implementation: Level 1 (L1), Level 2 (L2), and Level 3 (L3). The responsibility for these levels of support is taken on by Newlogic, ensuring that the product performs at its optimal level and customer satisfaction is prioritized. In alignment with our strong commitment to the open-source community, L3 support is offered for issues that are raised directly on Github. This approach promotes transparency, encourages community-based problem solving, and reflects our strong commitment to the principles of open-source development. The aim is to ensure that the functionality and reliability of our product are upheld, and the vibrant open-source community that has played a significant role in our success is supported.

The SLA outlines the expected timeframes and processes for issue resolution, thus ensuring the system's users that any critical issues will be addressed promptly and effectively. These measures are a testament to the dedication and commitment to maintaining the operational efficiency and security of OpenSPP.
