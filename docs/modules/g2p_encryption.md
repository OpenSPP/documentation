# G2P Encryption Module

```{warning}

This is a work-in-progress document.

## Overview

The [g2p_encryption](g2p_encryption) module provides a base framework for managing encryption providers within OpenSPP. It defines a generic interface for different encryption methods and allows for their seamless integration into various OpenSPP components.

## Features

- **Encryption Provider Model:** The module introduces the `g2p.encryption.provider` model, which serves as a template for defining and configuring different types of encryption providers.
- **Encryption Methods:** The model provides standardized methods like `encrypt_data`, `decrypt_data`, `jwt_sign`, `jwt_verify`, and `get_jwks` for interacting with encryption providers.
- **Configuration:** The module allows administrators to configure and manage encryption providers through the Odoo interface.
- **Extensibility:** The generic design enables developers to easily extend the module by implementing new encryption providers based on the provided interface.

## Role and Integration

The [g2p_encryption](g2p_encryption) module is foundational for incorporating encryption functionality across other OpenSPP modules. Modules requiring encryption capabilities can depend on this module and utilize the available encryption providers. For instance, modules dealing with sensitive data like beneficiary information or financial transactions can leverage this module to ensure data security.

## Additional Notes

- The [g2p_encryption](g2p_encryption) module itself does not implement any specific encryption algorithm. It provides the framework for other modules to implement and utilize encryption methods.
- The choice of encryption provider and configuration is left to the system administrators, allowing for flexibility and adaptation to specific security requirements.
- Developers are encouraged to contribute to this module by adding support for new encryption algorithms and standards.

## Dependencies

The [g2p_encryption](g2p_encryption) module has no direct dependencies on other modules. It is designed as a standalone module that other modules requiring encryption functionality can depend on.
