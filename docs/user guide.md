# Welcome to the OpenSPP project! 

OpenSPP is an open source digital social protection information system that aims to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of social protection systems in low and middle-income countries.

OpenSPP is an open source integrated and digital social protection information system based on an ERP called Odoo. We leverage other Digital Public Goods (DPGs) whenever possible to offer a comprehensive and integrated solution.

The system is built on a modular architecture, allowing organizations to customize and extend the platform to meet their specific needs and requirements. It is also designed to be scalable, adaptable, and interoperable, making it easy to integrate with other systems and platforms.
