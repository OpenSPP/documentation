# Getting Started

## How the documentation is organized

This overview of how OpenSPPâ€™s documentation is organized will help you know where to look for certain things:

- [Tutorials](https://docs.openspp.org/tutorial/) are lessons that guide you through a topic and help you to achieve basic competence and familiarity with the platform. Tutorials will help you to make sense of the rest of the documentation. Start here if you are new to OpenSPP.
- [How-to guides](https://docs.openspp.org/howto/) provide detailed instructions on how to use the specific features and modules of OpenSPP. They provide step by step guidance on how to perform a specific task or achieve a particular goal. They are more advanced than tutorials and assume some knowledge of how OpenSPP works.
- [Technical Reference](https://docs.openspp.org/technical_reference/) are technical descriptions of the software, and describe how OpenSPP works and how to use it. They are technical documents and assume that you have a basic understanding of key software concepts.
- [Explanations](https://docs.openspp.org/explanation/) help to clarify, deepen and broaden understanding of a subject. They help to explain the background and context of why certain things are done e.g. design decisions, historical reasons, technical constraints. Explanations help to give a bigger picture and join things together.
- [OpenSPP Glossary](https://docs.openspp.org/glossary.html) provides definitions and explanations of terms or specialized language used in social protection. Translations are provided in French, Spanish and Arabic.

## Technical information

OpenSPP is built on top of [Odoo 17.0](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/17.0/), a popular open-source [ERP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning). It is designed to be easy to install and maintain, and can be run on any Linux distribution.
