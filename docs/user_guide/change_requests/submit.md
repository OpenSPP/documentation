# Submit a Change Request

This guide is for **users** (program staff, registry officers) who need to submit change requests on behalf of registrants.

## What You'll Do

Create a change request to modify registrant information, such as updating personal details, adding household members, or changing contact information. Change requests go through an approval workflow before being applied.

## Before You Start

- You need **Registry Officer** or **Change Request Officer** permissions
- Know which registrant needs the update
- Have any required documentation ready (e.g., ID documents for new members)

## Steps

### 1. Open Change Requests

Click **Registry** in the sidebar, then select **Change Requests**.

## What Happens Next?

- The request goes to the approval queue
- Approvers receive a notification
- You can track the request status in the Change Requests list
- Once approved, the changes are applied to the registrant's record
- You'll receive a notification when the request is approved or rejected

## Are You Stuck?

**Can't find the New button?**
You may not have the right permissions. Contact your administrator to request **Change Request Officer** access.

**Don't see the registrant in the dropdown?**
Make sure the person or household is already registered in the system. You can only create change requests for existing registrants.

**Request Type dropdown is empty?**
No change request types have been configured. Contact your administrator or implementer to set up change request types.

**Submit button is disabled?**
Check that all required fields are filled in. Required fields are marked with a red asterisk (*).

**Need to cancel a request?**
If the request is still in **Draft** status, you can delete it. Once submitted, you'll need to ask an approver to reject it.

**Made a mistake after submitting?**
If an approver sends it back for **Revision**, you can edit the request and resubmit. Otherwise, you'll need to create a new change request.
