## Finding Your Way Around

### Using Search

The search bar at the top lets you quickly find records.

![Using the search bar](/_images/en-us/user_guide/getting_started/navigation/search-bar.png)

1. Click in the search bar (or press `/` on your keyboard).

2. Type what you are looking for (a name, ID number, etc.).

3. Press **Enter** or click the search icon.

### Filtering Lists

When viewing a list of records, you can filter to find what you need.

![Filter options on a list](/_images/en-us/user_guide/getting_started/navigation/filters.png)

1. Click the **Filters** dropdown above the list.

2. Select a filter option (for example, "Active" to show only active records).

3. The list updates to show only matching records.

To remove a filter, click the **X** next to the filter tag.

### List View vs. Form View

OpenSPP has two main ways to view records:

**List View** shows many records at once in a table format.

![List view example](/_images/en-us/user_guide/getting_started/navigation/list-view.png)

**Form View** shows one record with all its details.

![Form view example](/_images/en-us/user_guide/getting_started/navigation/form-view.png)

To switch between views:

- From List View: Click on any record to open it in Form View
- From Form View: Click the breadcrumb or use the back arrow to return to List View

### Navigating Between Records

When viewing a record in Form View, use the arrow buttons to move to the next or previous record without going back to the list.

## Are You Stuck?

Try these steps:
1. Refresh the page (press F5)
2. Clear your browser cache
3. Try a different browser
4. Contact IT support if the problem continues
