# Hardware integration

Hardware integration is a key feature of OpenSPP, allowing for the integration of hardware devices to improve the {term}`efficiency` and {term}`effectiveness` of {term}`social protection` programs. Currently, OpenSPP supports two types of hardware integrations:

**Document scanner through FTP**: This integration allows for the automated scanning and uploading of documents, such as {term}`beneficiary` {term}`identification` documents or proof of income, directly into the OpenSPP platform. This reduces the need for manual data entry and improves the accuracy and timeliness of data.

**ID Document scanner**: This integration enables the scanning and verification of beneficiary identification documents, such as national IDs or passports, using the Thales AT10K scanner. With this integration, program administrators can quickly and easily verify the identity of {term}`beneficiaries` and ensure that {term}`benefits` are delivered to the correct individuals.
