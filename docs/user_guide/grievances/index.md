# Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM)

This guide is for **users** – government staff, program officers, and support personnel who handle complaints and feedback from beneficiaries.

## What is the GRM?

The Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM) helps you manage complaints, appeals, and feedback from beneficiaries and stakeholders. It provides a clear process for:

- Recording and tracking complaints from multiple channels (portal, phone, in-person, field visits)
- Investigating issues systematically
- Making fair decisions with proper documentation
- Meeting response time targets (SLAs)
- Escalating complex issues when needed

The GRM handles **short-term issues** (complaints about payments, eligibility, service quality). For **long-term support needs**, see Case Management (a separate system that works alongside GRM).

## What You'll Learn

This section covers:

1. **{doc}`submit`** - How to log complaints from beneficiaries
2. **{doc}`case_management`** - How to investigate and resolve grievances
3. **{doc}`sla`** - How to track deadlines and escalate urgent cases

## Before You Start

You need one of these access levels:
- **GRM Officer** - Create and manage grievances assigned to you
- **GRM Supervisor** - Review, approve, and reassign grievances
- **Call Centre Operator** - Log grievances from phone calls
- **Field Officer** - Submit grievances during field visits

If you can't access the GRM menu in the sidebar, contact your system administrator.

## Key Concepts

| Term | What It Means |
|------|---------------|
| **Ticket** | A single complaint or appeal recorded in the system |
| **Category** | The type of complaint (Payment, Eligibility, Service Quality, etc.) |
| **Severity** | How urgent the complaint is (Low, Medium, High, Critical) |
| **SLA** | Service Level Agreement - the deadline for resolving a complaint |
| **Escalation** | Moving a complaint to a supervisor or specialist team |
| **Resolution** | The final decision and actions taken to address the complaint |

## Common Workflows

### As a Call Centre Operator
1. Receive call from beneficiary
2. Record complaint details in GRM
3. Assign category and severity
4. Provide ticket number to caller
5. System automatically routes to appropriate officer

### As a GRM Officer
1. Review assigned tickets in your dashboard
2. Investigate by checking records and contacting parties
3. Request additional information if needed
4. Make a decision (Upheld, Rejected, etc.)
5. Record resolution and close ticket

### As a GRM Supervisor
1. Monitor team performance and SLA compliance
2. Review escalated tickets
3. Approve or reject decisions requiring oversight

## Are You Stuck?

**Can't find the GRM menu?**
You may not have the right permissions. Ask your administrator to add you to the appropriate GRM security group.

**Don't know which category to assign?**
Start with the most general category. GRM Officers can reclassify tickets during investigation.

**Beneficiary wants to check their complaint status?**
Give them their ticket number. They can log into the portal to track progress, or call back and reference the ticket number.

**Need help with a sensitive complaint (GBV, child abuse)?**
These should be marked "Highly Sensitive" and automatically route to protection specialists. If you're unsure, contact your supervisor immediately.
