# Configure ID and generate QR code

## Introduction

In this Tutorial you will learn how to configure the ID of a registrant and how to print its QR code.

## Prerequisites

To configure ID and generate QR code, you need to:

- Have existing individual records in your registry, either by creating records manually or importing records into OpenSPP.
- Have an access role as an **Operations Admin** or **Administrator**. Learn more about this in the guide [Administrating role-based access](https://docs.openspp.org/tutorial/user_guides/administrating_role_based_access.html)
- Make sure that the module **OpenSPP POS: ID Redemption** is installed and activated.

## Objective

By the end of this tutorial you will be able to configure ID types, manage IDs of Individuals and Groups, generate QR code of the IDs and be able to print it.

## Process

### Configure ID type

To be able to create IDs, you must first configure the ID types. Login to OpenSPP as administrator, click on the square tile icon beside **Registry**, then click on **Registry** from the menu.

Alternatively, you can also add an ID by **import to update an already existing individual or group** along with its new ID details, Read [Import registrant data](https://docs.openspp.org/tutorial/user_guides/import_registrant_data.html) to learn more. You would need the following column headers for the ID data.  
**reg_ids/id_type** \- ID pass, UMID etc.. make sure that the id type you will import is already defined in OpenSPP.  
**reg_ids/status** \- Valid or Invalid.  
**reg_ids/value** \- 11223412394, etc..

#### Edit ID

To edit an ID, click on the field to edit it. Once done click the **Save** icon beside the Gear icon. You may also click on the **Counterclockwise arrow** icon to undo any changes.

### Generate QR code

To generate QR code, make sure **OpenSPP POS: ID Redemption** is installed and activated on your OpenSPP instance. When installed, you should be able to see a **green printer button** beside the ID values from the ID tab of a Group or Individual.

Once you click the green printer button, a download of a pdf will automatically start which contains the ID information and QR code.
