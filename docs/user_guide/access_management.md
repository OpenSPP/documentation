# Access Management

## Introduction

User Access Management is a key component of OpenSPP that enables program administrators to control and manage user access to the platform's features and data. With OpenSPP's role-based access control system, administrators can define different levels of access for individual users or groups, ensuring that only authorized users have access to specific data and features.

There are different dimensions to access rights in OpenSPP, including access to specific application features and access to specific data or subsets of data (e.g., data related to a specific location). By defining these access rights, administrators can ensure that users are able to perform their roles and responsibilities effectively while minimizing the risk of data breaches or unauthorized access.

In this user guide, we will provide step-by-step instructions on how to manage user access in OpenSPP, including how to create and manage user accounts, assign roles and permissions, and customize user access rights. By the end of this guide, you should have a solid understanding of how to effectively manage user access in OpenSPP to ensure the security and integrity of your social protection program data.
