# Vouchers

## Overview

Vouchers and e-vouchers are versatile and effective tools for delivering social protection benefits to vulnerable populations. By providing beneficiaries with a voucher they can use to redeem specific goods or services, program administrators can ensure benefits are used appropriately while giving beneficiaries the flexibility to choose the goods or services that best meet their needs.

In OpenSPP, vouchers are a standard feature available to all users. With the platform's built-in voucher management capabilities, program administrators can create, distribute, and track vouchers for various social protection programs.

This tutorial provides step-by-step instructions on how to use vouchers in OpenSPP for social protection programs. It covers setting up voucher parameters and eligibility criteria, generating and distributing vouchers, and tracking voucher usage. By the end of this tutorial, you should have a solid understanding of how vouchers can improve social protection programs' efficiency and effectiveness, and how to use OpenSPP's voucher management capabilities to achieve these goals.
