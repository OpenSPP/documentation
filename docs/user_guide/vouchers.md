# Vouchers

## Introduction

Vouchers and e-vouchers are a versatile and effective tool for delivering social protection benefits to vulnerable populations. By providing beneficiaries with a voucher that can be redeemed for specific goods or services, program administrators can ensure that benefits are used as intended, while giving beneficiaries the flexibility to choose the goods or services that best meet their needs.

In OpenSPP, vouchers are a standard feature that is available to all users. With the platform's built-in voucher management capabilities, program administrators can quickly and easily create, distribute, and track vouchers for a variety of social protection programs.

In this tutorial, we will provide step-by-step instructions on how to use vouchers in OpenSPP for social protection programs. We will cover everything from setting up voucher parameters and eligibility criteria to generating and distributing vouchers, as well as tracking voucher usage. By the end of this tutorial, you should have a solid understanding of how vouchers can be used to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of social protection programs, and how to leverage OpenSPP's voucher management capabilities to achieve these goals.
