# Consent management

## Introduction

Consent management is an essential component of social protection programs that deal with personal data. In order to protect the privacy of beneficiaries and ensure that their personal information is being used and shared appropriately, it is important to obtain their consent for data processing and sharing.

OpenSPP provides a built-in consent management system that enables program administrators to manage and track consent from beneficiaries. With OpenSPP's consent management, administrators can easily obtain, store, and manage consent from beneficiaries for data processing and sharing.

By giving beneficiaries control over how their data is used and shared, OpenSPP's consent management helps to build trust and confidence in social protection programs. This not only ensures compliance with data protection regulations, but also improves the overall effectiveness of social protection programs by promoting transparency and accountability. In this user guide, we will provide step-by-step instructions on how to use OpenSPP's consent management system to obtain and manage consent from beneficiaries.
