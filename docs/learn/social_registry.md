# Social Registry

## What is a Social Registry?

A social registry is a database or system that contains {term}`information` about individuals or households within a specific population. Its purpose is to provide a centralized and up-to-date source of data that can be used for {term}`targeting`, planning, and implementing {term}`social protection` programs. Social registries are designed to enhance fairness and equity in the targeting of social protection programs by introducing systematic and transparent approaches to identify those in need. Social registries are most commonly used in poverty-targeted social protection programs. 

One of the first examples of a social registry was developed in the late 1990s for the Bolsa Familia social protection program in Brazil. The Cadastro Único collects and stores information about Brazil’s low-income and vulnerable populations. It is now used as a key tool by the Government, not only for identifying and selecting households for the Bolsa Familia, but also to identify and provide assistance to the most vulnerable Brazilians via 27 other social programs. 

Social registries are now used in social protection programs across the world. Well-known examples include Mexico’s "Padrón Único de Beneficiarios" (Unified {term}`beneficiary registry`), often abbreviated as PUB, which is part of the Prospera social protection program, and the Philippines’ Listahan which plays a crucial role in the implementation of the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps).


## Operational Functionality of Social Registries

The operational functions of social registries differ among the countries using them, depending on what is required of the system, and the existing broader systems of information management. In general, social registries have the following operational functions: 

1. **Data Collection.** The most important part of a social registry is the standardized {term}`registration` questionnaire used to gather information on a given population’s demographic, socio-economic and {term}`household` information. {term}`identification` documents or certificates may also be checked and scanned at this stage. At this stage, individuals or households are referred to as registrants. 

2. **{term}`data validation` and verification.** Applicant data can be validated through cross checks with documents, other administrative systems, or through local community validation processes. 

3. **Information {term}`intermediation`**: Bridging the gap between citizen-provided data and the requirements of social programs, integrating with systems like National IDs, CRVS and disability registries.

4. **Inclusion and exclusion criteria.** Clear criteria, formats and indicators are defined to facilitate transparent and standardized {term}`eligibility` assessment for social programs. Specific criteria can be used to identify and target vulnerable groups, such as pregnant women, children, or individuals with disabilities. Households can be ranked based on assessment of their needs and conditions, such as with a proxy means test.

5. **{term}`decentralized` eligibility determination.** Lists of potentially eligible households or ranked lists of all households can be shared with individual program implementers of decentralized counterparts, and adapted to local contexts and needs.

6. **Ongoing registration and information updates.** Social registries provide on-demand registrations through local government or program offices. Periodic data collections can be carried out to capture changes in circumstances or new information such as births, death, migrations or changes in economic conditions. 

7. **Privacy and confidentiality.** Social registries hold large amounts of sensitive {term}`personal data`. The privacy and confidentiality of individuals' data must be protected in accordance with a country’s legal and ethical standards. 

8. **{term}`appeals` and grievances** Social registries must provide feedback mechanisms or be integrated with separate {term}`grievance` redress mechanisms (GRM) so that registrants can appeal against eligibility decisions or report inaccuracies or errors.  

9. **Reporting and analysis.** Social registries may have self-contained functions to generate reports and analyze registry data. Or they may be integrated with separate data analysis tools and dashboards to inform policy decisions, program planning, and resource allocation.

10. **Architectural components.** Comprise of data intake and exchange, {term}`data protection`, management interfaces, interoperability focus, and necessary ICT infrastructure.


## Integration and interoperability

Social registries can be stand-alone or they may form part of a broader system of information management for the implementation and delivery of social protection. In the latter case, integration and interoperability are key aspects. 
- **Interoperability with other administrative systems.** Social registries vary in their degree of interoperability. Some are self-contained, while others are interoperable with systems such as national identity systems, civil registries, and disability registries.
- **Integration with broader {term}`information systems`.** System integration can improve coordination with integrated {term}`beneficiary` registries (also known as single registries), program management, payment systems, program monitoring and data analytics, and grievance and redress mechanisms.   
- **Stand-alone social registries may be preferred.** In certain situations, stand-alone social registries may be preferred due to legal and ethical considerations where integration may raise concerns about data security and privacy.   


## Social registries and integrated beneficiary registries

Integrated beneficiary registries (IBR), also known as **single registries**, are also considered to be a fundamental approach to information management in social protection systems. IBRs bring together data from different social protection programs or other sources into a unified system, with the purpose of creating a more efficient and coordinated approach to managing and delivering social protection and other {term}`social services`. 
Social registries and IBRs may be used in tandem within broader information systems for social protection. But they may also function independently: social registries can be stand-alone, and IBRs can function without social registries.


### Key Aspects

1. **From Potential to Actual {term}`beneficiaries`**: Social Registries encompass a broader scope, including all individuals assessed for potential eligibility. Once individuals or households are deemed eligible and start receiving {term}`benefits`, they transition from being registrants in the Social Registry to beneficiaries in the IBR.

2. **Data Flow and Utilization**: Information from the Social Registry is pivotal in populating the IBR. As individuals become program beneficiaries, their data moves from the potential eligibility pool of the Social Registry to the active beneficiary management system of the IBR.

3. **Complementarity in Function**: While the Social Registry is geared towards identifying and assessing potential beneficiaries, the IBR focuses on managing and monitoring current beneficiaries. This complementarity ensures that social protection systems are both inclusive (identifying all potential beneficiaries) and efficient (effectively managing those who receive benefits).

4. **Policy and Operational Insights**: The integration of these registries provides a comprehensive view of the social protection landscape. The Social Registry offers insights into the broader demographic and socioeconomic profiles of potential beneficiaries, while the IBR offers detailed information on current beneficiaries, aiding in policy formulation and program management.

5. **Challenges in Integration**: Ensuring seamless data exchange and maintaining data integrity between these systems are key challenges. Addressing issues of {term}`data privacy`, real-time data updating, and interoperability is crucial for the effective functioning of both registries.

## What about OpenSPP?

### OpenSPP as a Social Registry

OpenSPP's robust architecture makes it an ideal candidate for functioning as a Social Registry, with the following key features:
