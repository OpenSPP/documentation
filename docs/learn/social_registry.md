# Social Registry

## What is a Social Registry?

A Social Registry is an information system critical in the early stages of social protection program delivery. It manages outreach, intake, registration, and assessment of potential eligibility for social programs. Its primary role is to facilitate the inclusion of targeted populations into social programs, ensuring equitable access to social benefits. In social registries, individuals or households are referred to as "registrants."

## Operational Functionality of Social Registries

Social Registries serve as complex information systems, vital to the operational aspects of social protection programs. They encompass:

1. **Data Collection and Management**: Collecting diverse information to determine potential eligibility, including identification, socio-economic background, housing, and assets.

2. **Data Standardization**: Transforming collected data into standardized formats and indicators to facilitate eligibility assessment for various social programs.

3. **Information Intermediation**: Bridging the gap between citizen-provided data and the requirements of social programs, integrating with systems like National IDs, CRVS and disability registries.

4. **Dynamic Inclusion**: Addressing both chronic and transient poverty, dynamic social registries provide an on-demand data collection mechanism, crucial for identifying households affected by sudden economic or personal changes.

5. **Data Validation and Verification**: Ensuring data accuracy and consistency, including cross-referencing with other systems and managing grievances.

6. **Architectural Components**: Comprising data intake and exchange, data protection, management interfaces, interoperability focus, and necessary ICT infrastructure.

7. **Integration with Wider Social Program Systems**: Typically part of broader information systems supporting social programs, distinct from beneficiary registries, to manage both potential and actual beneficiaries effectively.

8. **Interoperability with Other Systems**: Varying in their degree of interoperability, some registries are self-contained, while others integrate extensively with centralized data stores for enhanced data management capabilities.


## Relation to Beneficiary Registry

Social Registries and Beneficiary Registries, while distinct, are interconnected parts of social protection systems. Social Registries assess potential eligibility, serving as the initial point of contact. This phase is crucial for identifying who might need support. Beneficiary Registries, on the other hand, track individuals or households receiving benefits, monitoring their program participation and eligibility status. The integration of these registries is essential for efficient and responsive social protection services.

## What about OpenSPP?

OpenSPP, known for its versatile architecture, can function effectively as a Social or Beneficiary Registry. It handles initial intake and registration, managing a broad spectrum of data, making it ideal for streamlining outreach and intake processes. A key strength of OpenSPP is its integration capacity, seamlessly connecting with existing registries and expanding capabilities through upcoming integrations like the [G2P-Connect](https://g2pconnect.cdpi.dev/g2p-connect/readme) and the [Social Protection Digital Convergence Initiative](https://spdci.org) API standard. 

In summary, OpenSPP's adaptability and integration capabilities make it a valuable asset for organizations involved in social protection, enhancing the effectiveness and reach of social programs.
