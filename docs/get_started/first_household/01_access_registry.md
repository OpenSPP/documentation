# Step 1: Access the Registry

This tutorial is for **users** who are new to OpenSPP and want to learn how to access the beneficiary registry.

## What You'll Do

Learn how to navigate to the Registry module and understand the Registry Search Portal - the central interface for managing registrants in OpenSPP.

## Before You Start

- You need access to OpenSPP with Registry Officer or Administrator permissions
- OpenSPP should be installed and running
- Allow 2-3 minutes to complete this step

## The Scenario

You're a registry officer who needs to register a new household in the system. The Garcia family has arrived at your office to enroll in social protection programs. First, you need to access the registry to create their records.

## Steps

### 1. Navigate to Registry

After logging in to OpenSPP, you'll see the sidebar menu on the left. Click **Registry** to access the beneficiary management portal.

### 2. Explore the Registry Search Portal

The Registry Search Portal is the main interface for managing registrants. It provides a privacy-first approach where you search for records rather than browsing lists.

Key elements of the interface:

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Search Bar** | Find registrants by name, ID, phone, or email |
| **New Individual** button | Register a new person |
| **New Group** button | Register a new household or family |
| **Advanced** | Access advanced search filters |
| **All Registrants** dropdown | Filter by registrant type |
| **Recently Viewed** | Quick access to records you've viewed recently |

### 3. Understand Registrants vs Beneficiaries

In OpenSPP:

- A **registrant** is any person or group recorded in the registry
- A **beneficiary** is a registrant who has been enrolled in a program

You'll create registrants first. They become beneficiaries only after enrollment in a program.

## What You Accomplished

You've learned how to:

- Access the Registry module from the sidebar
- Navigate to the Registry Search Portal
- Understand the key interface elements

## Are You Stuck?

**Can't find Registry in the sidebar?**
Make sure you're logged in with appropriate permissions. Ask your system administrator to grant you access to the Registry module.

**Don't see New Individual or New Group buttons?**
You may not have permission to create new records. Contact your administrator to grant you the appropriate access rights.

## Next Step

Now that you understand the registry interface, you're ready to create your first household. Continue to [Step 2: Create a Household](02_create_household.md).
