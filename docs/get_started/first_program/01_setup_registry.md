# Step 1: Access the beneficiary registry

This tutorial is for **users** who are new to OpenSPP and want to learn how to access the beneficiary registry.

## What you'll do

Learn how to navigate to the Registry module and understand the Registry Search Portal - the central interface for managing beneficiaries in OpenSPP.

## Before you start

- You need access to OpenSPP with appropriate permissions
- OpenSPP should be installed and running
- Allow 2-3 minutes to complete this step

## The scenario

You're setting up a **Cash Transfer for Vulnerable Families** program. This program will provide monthly cash assistance to low-income families with children under 5 years old. First, you need to understand how to access and use the beneficiary registry.

## Steps

### 1. Navigate to registry

After logging in to OpenSPP, you'll see the sidebar menu on the left. Click **Registry** to access the beneficiary management portal.

### 2. Explore the registry search portal

The registry search portal is the main interface for managing beneficiaries. It provides a privacy-first approach where you search for records rather than browsing lists.

Key elements of the interface:

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Search Bar** | Find beneficiaries by name, ID, phone, or email |
| **New Individual** button | Register a new person |
| **New Group** button | Register a new household or family |
| **Advanced** | Access advanced search filters |
| **All Registrants** dropdown | Filter by registrant type |
| **Recently Viewed** | Quick access to records you've viewed recently |

### 3. Register new individuals

Click the **New Individual** button to register individual people (e.g., a single person applying for assistance).

### 4. Register new groups

Click the **New Group** button to register households or families (e.g., a family unit applying together).

### 5. Use the search function

The search bar allows you to find existing beneficiaries. Click on the search bar to begin typing.

Enter at least 3 characters to search by:
- Name
- ID number
- Phone number
- Email address

### 6. View search results

In this example, searching for "Garcia" returns matching beneficiaries. The results show the beneficiary name, type (Individual or Group), and when the record was last updated.

This privacy-first search approach ensures beneficiary data is protected - you must actively search for records rather than browsing through lists.

## What you accomplished

You've learned how to:

- Access the Registry module from the sidebar
- Navigate to the registry search portal
- Understand the key interface elements for managing beneficiaries
- Use the search function to find existing records

## Key concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Groups** | Households or families registered as a unit |
| **Individuals** | Single persons in the registry |
| **Privacy-First Search** | Must search to find records; no open browsing |
| **Recently Viewed** | Quick access to records you've accessed |

## Are you stuck?

**Can't find Registry in the sidebar?**
Make sure you're logged in with appropriate permissions. Ask your system administrator to grant you access to the Registry module.

**Search not returning results?**
Enter at least 3 characters. The search matches against name, ID, phone, and email fields.

**Don't see New Individual or New Group buttons?**
You may not have permission to create new records. Contact your administrator to grant you the appropriate access rights.

## Next Step

Now that you understand the registry interface, you're ready to add beneficiary data. Continue to [Step 2: Import Beneficiaries](02_import_beneficiaries.md).
