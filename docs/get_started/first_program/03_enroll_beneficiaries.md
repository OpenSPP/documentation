# Step 3: Import and enroll beneficiaries

This tutorial is for **users** who want to import and enroll beneficiaries into an already created program.

## What you'll do

You will import and enroll beneficiaries into your program that are eligible based on the previously defined eligibility criteria.

## Before you start

- You completed [Step 2: Create Program](02_create_program.md)
- Your program **Cash Transfer for Vulnerable Families** exists
- You need **Program Manager** or **Administrator** access
- Allow 5-10 minutes to complete this step

## The scenario

You have created the program and you now want to import and enroll all the beneficiaries that are eligible according to your previously configured eligibility criteria.

## Steps

### 1. Open your program

Go to **Programs** from the main menu and click on **Cash transfer for vulnerable families** to open it.

## What you accomplished

You've successfully imported and enrolled eligible beneficiaries into the program.

## Are you stuck?

**Import Eligible button does nothing?**
- The program may not have an eligibility manager configured
- Contact your Program Manager to verify the configuration

**No registrants found during import?**
- Check that registrants exist in the Registry
- Verify the program's target type matches (individual vs. group)
- Review the eligibility criteria with your Program Manager

**Registrant shows "Not Eligible" after enrollment?**
- The registrant's data may not meet the eligibility criteria
- Open their profile and verify their information is complete
- Check with your Program Manager about the specific eligibility rules

**"Already enrolled in this program" error?**
- A registrant can only be enrolled once per program
- Check the program's beneficiary list for existing enrollment
- If they were exited, you may need to create a new enrollment

## Next step

Now that your eligibility rules are set, you're ready to run your first program cycle to identify eligible families. Continue to [Step 4: Understanding Program Cycle](04_run_cycle.md).
