# Getting started

New to OpenSPP? Well, you came to the right place: read this material to quickly get up and running.


![OpenSPP overview](_static/openspp_process.png)

`OpenSPP` is based on an open-source [ERP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning) called [Odoo 15.0](https://odoo.com/documentation/15.0/). It allows the project to take advantage of a vast ecosystem of existing integrations and modules.

It is a [Digital Public Good (DPG)](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/) and is building on top of other DPGs such as [OpenG2P](https://openg2p.org/).

`OpenSPP` is currently in development, and everything is evolving rapidly thanks to the input provided by our users. If you have any questions or needs, please do not hesitate to contact the team through Github issues or the [OpenSPP website](https://openspp.org/).
