# Configuration Guide

**For: Implementers** (M&E teams, technical staff comfortable with Kobo/CommCare level configuration)

This guide covers configuring OpenSPP without code - setting up eligibility rules, formulas, workflows, and system behavior through the OpenSPP Studio interface and configuration files.

## Overview

The Configuration Guide is designed for implementers who need to customize OpenSPP for their specific program requirements. No programming knowledge is required - configuration uses visual tools and simple expression languages.

## Topics Covered

- **OpenSPP Studio** - No-code configuration tool (NEW V2)
- **CEL Expressions** - Common Expression Language for rules and formulas
- **Eligibility Rules** - Configuring who qualifies for programs
- **Entitlement Formulas** - Calculating benefit amounts
- **Vocabulary System** - Standardized codes and terminologies (NEW V2)
- **Variables & Indicators** - Unified variable system (NEW V2)
- **Event Data** - Capturing external data from surveys and forms (V2 enhanced)
- **Change Request Types** - Configuring change request workflows (NEW V2)
- **Consent Configuration** - Managing data sharing consent (NEW V2)
- **Role configuration** - Configuring users, roles, and role-based access (and optionally local/area-scoped roles)
