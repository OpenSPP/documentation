# Eligibility Rules

**For: Implementers**

Eligibility rules determine which registrants qualify for programs and benefits. OpenSPP supports multiple eligibility manager types including the default manager, SQL-based rules, and tag-based rules.

## Topics Covered

- **Default Manager** - Standard eligibility configuration using CEL expressions
- **SQL-Based Rules** - Complex eligibility logic using database queries
- **Tag-Based Rules** - Simple inclusion/exclusion using registrant tags
- **Testing Rules** - Validate eligibility rules before deployment
- **Performance Optimization** - Best practices for large-scale deployments
