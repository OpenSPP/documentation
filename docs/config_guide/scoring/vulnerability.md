# Vulnerability Scoring Configuration

This guide is for **implementers** setting up vulnerability assessment scoring for crisis response and emergency assistance programs. Vulnerability scoring identifies households at risk even if they're not currently poor.

## What is Vulnerability Scoring?

Vulnerability scoring assesses household risk and resilience factors:
- **Risk exposure** - Natural disasters, conflict, health crises
- **Coping capacity** - Assets, social networks, access to services
- **Adaptive capacity** - Education, skills, economic diversity
- **Current shocks** - Recent events affecting the household

Unlike PMT (which measures poverty), vulnerability scoring identifies households that could fall into poverty or crisis.

## When to Use Vulnerability Scoring

| Use Vulnerability Scoring For | Don't Use For |
|-------------------------------|---------------|
| Emergency cash transfers | Long-term poverty programs |
| Disaster response targeting | Universal basic income |
| Climate adaptation programs | Administrative census |
| Food security interventions | Routine service delivery |
| Epidemic response | Political targeting |

## Vulnerability vs. Poverty

| Aspect | PMT (Poverty) | Vulnerability Scoring |
|--------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Measures** | Current economic status | Risk of future crisis |
| **Timeframe** | Point-in-time snapshot | Forward-looking |
| **Indicators** | Assets, housing, income | Shocks, coping, resilience |
| **Updates** | Annual or biennial | After major events |
| **Use Case** | Routine social protection | Emergency response |

**You can use both:** A household may be non-poor but highly vulnerable (e.g., small business owners in flood zones).

## Vulnerability Components

A comprehensive vulnerability model includes:

1. **Exposure Indicators** - Geographic and demographic risk factors
2. **Sensitivity Indicators** - Household characteristics that amplify shocks
3. **Adaptive Capacity Indicators** - Resources to cope with shocks
4. **Current Shocks** - Recent events impacting the household

## Step-by-Step Configuration

### Step 1: Create the Vulnerability Model

Go to **Scoring → Scoring Models** and create:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Name** | 2024 Vulnerability Assessment |
| **Code** | VULN_2024 |
| **Category** | vulnerability |
| **Calculation Method** | weighted_sum |
| **Active** | ☑ (after configuration) |
| **Effective Date** | 2024-01-01 |
| **Description** | Multi-dimensional vulnerability for disaster response |

### Step 2: Add Exposure Indicators

Exposure indicators measure risk factors in the household's environment.

#### Geographic Hazard Risk

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Code | hazard_zone |
| Name | Hazard Zone Classification |
| Field Path | household.area_id.hazard_level |
| Weight | 0.20 |
| Calculation Type | mapped |
| Required | Yes |
| Sequence | 1 |

**Value Mappings:**

| Input Value | Output Score | Notes |
|-------------|--------------|-------|
| high_risk | 10 | Flood plain, landslide area, cyclone path |
| moderate_risk | 6 | Secondary hazard zone |
| low_risk | 3 | Minimal environmental risk |
| no_risk | 0 | Safe zone |

#### Distance to Services

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Code | distance_health |
| Name | Distance to Health Facility |
| Field Path | household.distance_to_health_km |
| Weight | 0.08 |
| Calculation Type | range |
| Required | Yes |
| Sequence | 2 |

**Value Mappings (Range):**

| Min | Max | Output Score | Notes |
|-----|-----|--------------|-------|
| 0 | 2 | 0 | Within walking distance |
| 2.01 | 5 | 3 | Accessible with transport |
| 5.01 | 10 | 6 | Remote access |
| 10.01 | 999 | 10 | Very remote |

### Step 3: Add Sensitivity Indicators

Sensitivity indicators amplify the impact of shocks.

#### Household Dependency

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Code | dependency_ratio |
| Name | Dependency Ratio |
| Field Path | household.dependency_ratio |
| Weight | 0.15 |
| Calculation Type | range |
| Required | Yes |
| Sequence | 3 |

**Formula for dependency ratio:** (children under 15 + elderly over 64) ÷ (working age 15-64) × 100

**Value Mappings (Range):**

| Min | Max | Output Score | Notes |
|-----|-----|--------------|-------|
| 0 | 50 | 0 | Low dependency |
| 50.01 | 100 | 5 | Moderate dependency |
| 100.01 | 200 | 8 | High dependency |
| 200.01 | 999 | 10 | Very high dependency |

**How to create calculated dependency ratio:**

Use a CEL formula indicator:

```cel
(household.members.filter(m, m.age < 15 || m.age > 64).size() /
 household.members.filter(m, m.age >= 15 && m.age <= 64).size()) * 100
```

Or create a variable in **Studio → Variables** and reference it.

#### Disability in Household

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Code | has_disability |
| Name | Household Has Member with Disability |
| Field Path | household.has_disabled_member |
| Weight | 0.12 |
| Calculation Type | mapped |
| Required | No |
| Default Value | False |
| Sequence | 4 |

**Value Mappings:**

| Input Value | Output Score |
|-------------|--------------|
| True | 10 |
| False | 0 |

#### Female-Headed Household

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Code | female_headed |
| Name | Female-Headed Household |
| Field Path | household.head.gender |
| Weight | 0.08 |
| Calculation Type | mapped |
| Required | Yes |
| Sequence | 5 |

**Value Mappings:**

| Input Value | Output Score | Notes |
|-------------|--------------|-------|
| female | 8 | Higher vulnerability in many contexts |
| male | 0 | |

**Important:** Adjust weight based on local context. In some settings, female-headed households may have equal or better outcomes.

### Step 4: Add Adaptive Capacity Indicators

Adaptive capacity reduces vulnerability through resources and skills.

#### Livelihood Diversity

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Code | income_sources |
| Name | Number of Income Sources |
| Field Path | household.income_source_count |
| Weight | 0.12 |
| Calculation Type | range |
| Required | Yes |
| Sequence | 6 |

**Value Mappings (Range - Inverse Scoring):**

| Min | Max | Output Score | Notes |
|-----|-----|--------------|-------|
| 3 | 99 | 0 | Multiple income sources = less vulnerable |
| 2 | 2 | 5 | Two sources |
| 1 | 1 | 10 | Single income source = most vulnerable |
| 0 | 0 | 10 | No income |

#### Savings or Assets

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Code | has_savings |
| Name | Has Savings or Productive Assets |
| Field Path | household.has_savings |
| Weight | 0.10 |
| Calculation Type | mapped |
| Required | No |
| Default Value | False |
| Sequence | 7 |

**Value Mappings:**

| Input Value | Output Score |
|-------------|--------------|
| True | 0 |
| False | 10 |

#### Education of Household Head

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Code | head_education |
| Name | Education Level of Household Head |
| Field Path | household.head.education_level |
| Weight | 0.08 |
| Calculation Type | mapped |
| Required | Yes |
| Sequence | 8 |

**Value Mappings:**

| Input Value | Output Score |
|-------------|--------------|
| tertiary | 0 |
| secondary | 3 |
| primary | 6 |
| none | 10 |

#### Social Support Network

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Code | social_network |
| Name | Access to Social Support |
| Field Path | household.social_support_score |
| Weight | 0.07 |
| Calculation Type | range |
| Required | No |
| Default Value | 0 |
| Sequence | 9 |

**Value Mappings (Range - Inverse):**

| Min | Max | Output Score | Notes |
|-----|-----|--------------|-------|
| 8 | 10 | 0 | Strong network |
| 5 | 7 | 4 | Moderate network |
| 2 | 4 | 7 | Weak network |
| 0 | 1 | 10 | No support |

**How to assess:** Use a simple survey question: "How many people/organizations can you ask for help in an emergency?" (0-10 scale)

### Step 5: Add Current Shock Indicators

Recent shocks increase immediate vulnerability.

#### Recent Job Loss

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Code | recent_job_loss |
| Name | Job Loss in Last 6 Months |
| Field Path | household.recent_job_loss |
| Weight | 0.10 |
| Calculation Type | mapped |
| Required | No |
| Default Value | False |
| Sequence | 10 |

**Value Mappings:**

| Input Value | Output Score |
|-------------|--------------|
| True | 10 |
| False | 0 |

#### Recent Health Shock

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Code | health_shock |
| Name | Major Health Expense in Last Year |
| Field Path | household.recent_health_shock |
| Weight | 0.10 |
| Calculation Type | mapped |
| Required | No |
| Default Value | False |
| Sequence | 11 |

**Value Mappings:**

| Input Value | Output Score |
|-------------|--------------|
| True | 10 |
| False | 0 |

### Step 6: Define Vulnerability Thresholds

Classify households by vulnerability level:

| Min Score | Max Score | Classification Code | Classification Label | Priority |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------|----------------------|----------|
| 0.0 | 30.0 | LOW_VULN | Low Vulnerability | 4 |
| 30.01 | 50.0 | MODERATE_VULN | Moderate Vulnerability | 3 |
| 50.01 | 70.0 | HIGH_VULN | High Vulnerability | 2 |
| 70.01 | 100.0 | EXTREME_VULN | Extreme Vulnerability | 1 |

**Priority:** Use for targeting - "1" means "assist first" in emergency response.

### Step 7: Test the Model

Create test cases for different vulnerability profiles:

#### Test Case 1: Extreme Vulnerability

**Profile:** Elderly female-headed household in flood zone, recently lost job

| Indicator | Value | Score | Weight | Weighted |
|-----------|-------|-------|--------|----------|
| Hazard Zone | high_risk | 10 | 0.20 | 2.0 |
| Distance Health | 8 km | 6 | 0.08 | 0.48 |
| Dependency Ratio | 150% | 8 | 0.15 | 1.2 |
| Has Disability | True | 10 | 0.12 | 1.2 |
| Female Headed | female | 8 | 0.08 | 0.64 |
| Income Sources | 1 | 10 | 0.12 | 1.2 |
| Has Savings | False | 10 | 0.10 | 1.0 |
| Head Education | primary | 6 | 0.08 | 0.48 |
| Social Network | 1 | 10 | 0.07 | 0.7 |
| Recent Job Loss | True | 10 | 0.10 | 1.0 |
| Health Shock | True | 10 | 0.10 | 1.0 |
| **Total** | | | **1.10** | **10.9** |

**Final Score:** 10.9 × (100/11) = **99.1** → **EXTREME_VULN** ✓

#### Test Case 2: Low Vulnerability

**Profile:** Young dual-income household in safe area, educated, savings

| Indicator | Value | Score | Weight | Weighted |
|-----------|-------|-------|--------|----------|
| Hazard Zone | no_risk | 0 | 0.20 | 0 |
| Distance Health | 1 km | 0 | 0.08 | 0 |
| Dependency Ratio | 40% | 0 | 0.15 | 0 |
| Has Disability | False | 0 | 0.12 | 0 |
| Female Headed | male | 0 | 0.08 | 0 |
| Income Sources | 3 | 0 | 0.12 | 0 |
| Has Savings | True | 0 | 0.10 | 0 |
| Head Education | tertiary | 0 | 0.08 | 0 |
| Social Network | 9 | 0 | 0.07 | 0 |
| Recent Job Loss | False | 0 | 0.10 | 0 |
| Health Shock | False | 0 | 0.10 | 0 |
| **Total** | | | **1.10** | **0.0** |

**Final Score:** 0.0 → **LOW_VULN** ✓

### Step 8: Activate and Deploy

1. **Set Active = True** on the model
2. **Train field teams** on collecting vulnerability data
3. **Run initial assessment** on target population
4. **Review distribution** of classifications
5. **Adjust thresholds** if needed based on available resources

## Context-Specific Models

Vulnerability indicators vary by context:

### Climate/Disaster Vulnerability

**Key indicators:**
- Hazard zone classification
- Housing structure quality
- Access to early warning systems
- Previous disaster experience
- Evacuation plan awareness

**Weights:** High weight on geographic exposure (30-40%)

### Food Security Vulnerability

**Key indicators:**
- Months of adequate food provisioning
- Crop diversity (for farmers)
- Access to markets
- Food consumption score
- Nutrition status of children

**Weights:** High weight on current food access (25-35%)

### Health Crisis Vulnerability (e.g., Pandemic)

**Key indicators:**
- Household has elderly or immunocompromised
- Access to healthcare
- Ability to social distance (housing density)
- Income disruption from lockdowns
- Digital access for remote work/education

**Weights:** High weight on health risk factors (30-40%)

### Conflict/Displacement Vulnerability

**Key indicators:**
- Displacement status (IDP, refugee, host community)
- Duration of displacement
- Legal status / documentation
- Loss of assets during displacement
- Social cohesion in host area

**Weights:** High weight on displacement factors (35-45%)

## Dynamic Scoring

Vulnerability changes faster than poverty. Consider:

| Update Trigger | When to Re-Score |
|----------------|------------------|
| **Natural disaster** | Immediately after event |
| **Economic crisis** | Quarterly during crisis period |
| **New shock data** | When household reports new shock |
| **Program exit** | Before graduation/exit decisions |
| **Routine** | Every 6 months minimum |

**Best practice:** Set up automatic re-scoring when key fields (like "recent_job_loss") are updated.

## Integration with Programs

### Emergency Cash Transfer

In eligibility manager:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Scoring Model | VULN_2024 |
| Required Classifications | HIGH_VULN, EXTREME_VULN |
| Priority Order | Use score (highest first) |

### Layered Approach

Combine vulnerability with poverty:

```cel
(pmt_score.classification in ['POOR', 'EXTREME_POOR']) &&
(vuln_score.classification in ['HIGH_VULN', 'EXTREME_VULN'])
```

This targets households that are BOTH poor AND vulnerable.

### Benefit Tiers by Vulnerability

| Vulnerability | Benefit Package |
|---------------|-----------------|
| EXTREME_VULN | Cash + food + shelter + psychosocial |
| HIGH_VULN | Cash + food |
| MODERATE_VULN | Food only |
| LOW_VULN | Monitoring (no immediate assistance) |

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Rapid Assessment

- 5-8 indicators only
- Focus on observable characteristics
- Can be completed in 15-20 minutes
- Lower precision but fast deployment

**Use:** Immediate post-disaster response

### Pattern 2: Comprehensive Assessment

- 15-20 indicators
- Include self-reported shock history
- Requires 45-60 minute interview
- Higher precision

**Use:** Planned vulnerability reduction programs

### Pattern 3: Community-Led Assessment

- Simple indicator set (8-10)
- Verified by community committees
- Includes local knowledge factors
- Weight community judgment

**Use:** Small-scale, community-based programs

## Are You Stuck?

**Scores don't reflect reality in the field?**
Vulnerability is contextual. Review your indicators with local teams. What matters in one setting may not matter in another.

**All households scoring high?**
You may be in a universally vulnerable population (e.g., refugee camp, disaster zone). Consider relative scoring or focus on specific sub-vulnerabilities.

**Indicators changing too fast?**
Use shorter effective dates and plan for frequent re-scoring. Alternatively, focus on structural vulnerability (less volatile) rather than current shocks.

**Need to combine with PMT?**
Create a composite score using CEL formula:
```cel
(pmt_score * 0.6) + (vuln_score * 0.4)
```

**Difficult to collect some indicators?**
Mark non-critical indicators as not required and set reasonable defaults. It's better to have incomplete data than no vulnerability assessment.

**Political pressure to adjust classifications?**
Document your methodology clearly. Use transparent, objective indicators. Make threshold decisions based on available budget and population needs, not individual cases.

## Rapid Deployment Checklist

When disaster strikes and you need to deploy quickly:

1. **Day 1-2:** Adapt existing model or create simplified version (5-8 indicators)
2. **Day 3-4:** Train field teams on data collection using mobile forms
3. **Day 5-7:** Begin assessments in affected areas
4. **Day 8-10:** Batch score and generate targeting list
5. **Day 11+:** Begin assistance delivery while continuing assessments

**Tools to prepare in advance:**
- [ ] Pre-configured vulnerability model
- [ ] Mobile data collection form (ODK, KoboToolbox)
- [ ] Field team training materials
- [ ] Batch scoring procedure documentation

## Best Practices

1. **Context matters:** Adapt indicators to local vulnerability drivers
2. **Update frequently:** Vulnerability changes faster than poverty
3. **Combine data sources:** Registration data + assessment + observation
4. **Validate with communities:** Do classifications match local perceptions?
5. **Plan for shocks:** Have simplified rapid-assessment models ready
6. **Track changes:** Monitor how classifications shift over time
7. **Link to response:** Vulnerability assessment must connect to assistance
8. **Protect data:** Vulnerability information is highly sensitive

## Security Considerations

Vulnerability data can expose households to risk:

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **Targeting by armed groups** | Anonymize geographic data, restrict access |
| **Stigma** | Use neutral terms, limit who sees detailed scores |
| **Data breaches** | Encrypt, limit export, audit access logs |
| **Manipulation** | Validate extreme scores, investigate suspicious patterns |

Configure strict access controls in **Settings → Users & Groups → Scoring Permissions**.
