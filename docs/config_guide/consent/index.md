# Consent Configuration

**For: Implementers**

## Topics Covered

- **Overview** - Introduction to consent management in OpenSPP
- **Field-Level Consent** - Configuring consent requirements for specific fields
- **Legal Basis Documentation** - Recording the legal basis for data processing
- **Fail-Closed Design** - How OpenSPP protects data by default
- **Consent Workflows** - Collecting and managing consent from registrants
- **Consent Reporting** - Tracking consent status and compliance
- **Withdrawal and Expiry** - Managing consent changes over time
