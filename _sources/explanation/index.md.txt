# Explanation

Explanations play a pivotal role by enhancing and broadening the reader's comprehension of various subjects in our OpenSPP documentation. Distinct from tutorials or how-to guides, which are action-oriented, explanations delve into theoretical knowledge, offering a foundation for study rather than direct application. This type of documentation does not focus on the minute details like reference materials but instead takes a higher-level perspective.
