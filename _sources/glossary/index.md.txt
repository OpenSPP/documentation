## Social protection

```{glossary}
:sorted: true

Area
    In the context of geotargeting for social protection programs, an area refers to a defined geographic region or territory, which can be of any size or shape. Areas can be hierarchical, meaning that they can be subdivided into smaller sub-areas, or aggregated into larger areas. For example, an area hierarchy could consist of country, state/province, district, sub-district, and village/ward. Areas can be defined using boundaries such as administrative divisions, natural features, or other criteria, and can be used to target social protection interventions to specific geographic regions.

Authentication
    Process of establishing confidence that a person is who they claim to be. Digital authentication generally
    involves a person electronically presenting one or more “authentication factors” to “assert” their
    identity—that is, to prove that they are the same person to whom the identity or credential was originally
    issued.

Beneficiary
Beneficiaries
    Individuals, families, or households who are enrolled in a program who are recipients of a benefit or service.

Beneficiary registry
    A database of beneficiaries of a social protection program. It is also a component of the beneficiary
    operations management system. These beneficiary registries contain information on program beneficiaries.
    Registries theat contain information on beneficiaries of multiple programs are known as integrated beneficiary
    registries.

Benefits
    Something tangible that is given by social protection programs to individuals, families, or households. They
    may be in the form of cash transfers or in-kind (such as food stamps, food rations, and subsidies). They may
    be noncontributory social assistance programs that are financed by general revenues, or they may be financed
    by direct contributions as a form of social insurance.

Biometrics or biometric data
    Physiological or behavioral characteristics that are unique to an individual (e.g., fingerprints, voice
    patterns) and that can be used as a means of automatic verification of identity.

Biometric identification
    Process of searching against a biometric enrollment database to find and return the biometric reference
    identifier(s) attributable to a single individual. The comparison may be either a one-to-one (1:1)
    matching—commonly referred to as “biometric verification”—where comparison is done against a single template,
    or one-to-many (1:N) matching, where comparison is done against multiple templates.

Cash transfers
    Money distributed to individuals, families, or households. Cash transfers are direct, regular, and predictable
    noncontributory cash payments that help beneficiaries to raise and smooth incomes. The term encompasses a
    range of instruments (e.g., social pensions, child grants, public works programs, unconditional or conditional
    cash transfers, etc.) and a spectrum of design, implementation, and financing options.

Community-based targeting
    A mechanism by which local communities are given discretion to determine which individuals, families, or
    households will be selected as beneficiaries of a particular program—or to determine which would be registered
    into a social registry for further assessment of their needs and conditions and eventual consideration for
    potential eligibility in social programs.

Complaint
    Grievances about the quality or type of processes for delivering benefits and/or services. They can arise due
    to delays, wait times, long lines, excessive documentation requirements, program staff behavior, public office
    accommodation, lack of information about the program decisions, difficulty accessing social protection
    benefits and/or services, and so on.

Compliance and noncompliance (of conditionalities)
    Compliance refers to the carrying out of specific conditionalities or co-responsibilities required for
    participation in the program by beneficiaries. Noncompliance refers to the failure to carry out said
    conditionalities.

Compliance conditions
    The conditions that a beneficiary must meet in order to continue receiving social protection benefits. These conditions are typically designed to ensure that beneficiaries are using the benefits appropriately and that they are meeting their obligations under the program. Compliance conditions may include requirements such as attending school, seeking employment, receiving healthcare services, or participating in training programs. Compliance conditions are used to ensure that beneficiaries are using the benefits as intended and that the program is achieving its goals. By defining compliance conditions, organizations can monitor and ensure that beneficiaries are complying with program requirements and using the benefits as intended.

Conditional cash transfers
CCTs
    Social assistance programs that make receipt of benefits conditional upon beneficiary actions (such as school
    attendance or health care visits), typically with the objectives of reducing poverty and providing incentives
    for investing in human capital.

Conditionalities
co-responsibilities
    The set of obligations that each beneficiary household must comply with in order to continue receiving cash
    benefits. Common examples include school attendance, health visits, and labor/work efforts.

Cycle
Distribution cycle
Program cycle
    TODO



De-duplication
    A technique to detect duplicate identity records. Biometric data—including fingerprints and iris scans—are
    commonly used to de-duplicate identities in order to identify false or inconsistent identity claims and to
    establish uniqueness.

Eligibility
    A state in which individuals, families, or households are entitled or qualified to receive a benefit or
    service because they satisfy certain criteria.

Eligibility criteria
    Eligibility criteria are factors used to determine whether an individual, family, or household is eligible (inclusion criteria) or not eligible (exclusion criteria) to participate in a program, such as social protection benefits. These criteria are typically defined by the government or organization implementing the program and may include factors such as age, income level, household size, employment status, or disability status. By defining eligibility criteria, organizations can determine which individuals or households are eligible to receive benefits under the program.

Family
    A family is defined for operational purposes as “a group of two people or more related by birth, marriage, or adoption and residing together; all such people (including related subfamily members) are considered as members of one family.”

Geographic targeting mechanisms
    A means of focusing interventions on individuals, families, or households living in a certain area.

Grievance
    Refers to two distinct categories: (1) complaints, and (2) appeals, and any other feedback from the general
    population, the intended population, registrants, applicants, beneficiaries, or other stakeholders of the
    social protection program.

Grievance redress mechanism (GRM)
    A formalized way to accept, sort, assess, and resolve complaints, appeals, and queries from the program
    beneficiaries and other stakeholders. The GRM is composed of a set of institutional structures, mandated
    rules, procedures, and processes through which complaints, appeals, and queries about the social protection
    program(s) are resolved.

Household
    Any individual or group of individuals who are living as one economic unit, who buy food and make meals
    together.

Human-centered design
    The continual process of understanding and meeting user needs. More specifically, human-centered design is a
    multidisciplinary approach to solving the needs and problems of the end-user (people) and the government’s
    capabilities for transformation.

In-kind transfers
    In-kind transfers refer to the provision of goods or services directly to social protection beneficiaries instead of cash payments. In-kind transfers may include items such as food, clothing, or housing, as well as services such as healthcare or education. In-kind transfers can be particularly useful in contexts where cash transfers may not be feasible or effective, and can help ensure that beneficiaries receive the support they need.

Indicator
    A value that is computed based on some information about the registrant's group composition. Indicators are
    used to determine the eligibility of a registrant for a social protection program. Indicators are computed
    based on the information available in the social registry. It can be a simple count of the number of
    individuals in the household, or a more complex calculation based on the age of the individuals in the
    household.

Payment service provider
    The public or private sector organization tasked with delivering the social protection program’s payments,
    such as a bank, post office, mobile network operator, nongovernmental organization, savings and credit
    cooperative organization, or microfinance institution.

Payments provision
    Processes to transfer and deliver benefits to recipients.

Payments reconciliation
    An accounting process that uses two sets of records to ensure figures are correct and in agreement. It
    confirms whether the money leaving an account matches the amount that has been spent and makes sure the two
    are balanced at the end of the recording period. For cash benefits, reconciliation confirms whether the funds
    transferred to the service provider match the amounts paid out to beneficiaries for that implementation cycle,
    and identifies any amounts not disbursed.

Program
Scheme
    Program, sometimes also called a campaign or a scheme, define a social program. A program is organizing the who, when, what and
    how beneficiaries receive as entitlements. 

Proxy Means Test (PMT)
    A statistical method used to determine the poverty status of a household, based on a set of indicators that are correlated with household income or consumption. PMTs are commonly used in social protection programs to identify beneficiaries who are eligible for support. PMTs are typically calculated using a set of criteria that may include household assets, housing conditions, education and occupation, and demographic characteristics such as household size, age, and gender composition. The specific criteria used to calculate PMTs may vary depending on the context and objectives of the social protection program. The results of the PMT can be used to identify households that are most in need of support, and to target social protection programs to those households.

Registrant
    Registrants. Individuals, families, or households who have provided their information during the intake and
    registration phase of the delivery chain. They may have provided their information at their own initiative (on
    demand; see applicants) or at the initiative of a public agency or program (as in the case of en masse
    registration/census sweeps). In the latter case, we do not call them applicants because they did not
    technically “apply” for benefits and services.

Registration
    The process of recording and verifying the information collected from the intake process. It can also involve
    pulling additional information from other administrative systems. Intake and registration usually happen
    simultaneously.

Social protection
    Systems that help individuals, families, and households, especially the poor and vulnerable, cope with crises
    and shocks, find jobs, invest in the health and education of their children, and protect the aging population.

Social registry
    Information systems that support the processes of outreach, intake and registration, and assessment of needs
    and conditions to determine potential eligibility for social programs. They maintain information on all
    registered households regardless of whether they eventually benefit from a social program. As such, we do not
    refer to households in social registries as “beneficiaries” but as “registered households.”

Targeting
    A policy that seeks to direct an intervention (benefit or service) to the intended population, to minimize the
    coverage of those not intended to be beneficiaries (errors of inclusion) and the noncoverage of intended
    beneficiaries (errors of exclusion). (We prefer to avoid using the term targeting in relation to an act of
    implementation.)

Unconditional cash transfers (UCTs)
    Programs that provide cash transfer benefits to individuals, families, or households without imposing any
    conditions on the beneficiaries.

Vouchers
    Vouchers are a type of non-cash payment that can be used to redeem specific goods or services. In the context of social protection programs, vouchers may be provided to beneficiaries to enable them to purchase essential items such as food, healthcare services, or other goods or services. Vouchers can help promote choice and autonomy for beneficiaries, while also providing targeted support for specific needs. Vouchers may be distributed in paper or electronic form and may be redeemable at specific retailers or service providers.
