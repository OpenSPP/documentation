# Installation Guide

## Installing using Docker for development

### Quick start

You need to have Docker and docker-compose installed on your system. You also need to have Python installed
and pip packages `invoke` and `pre-commit`.

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:openspp/openspp-docker.git
$ invoke develop img-pull img-build git-aggregate resetdb start
```

Then open `http://localhost:15069/` in your browser.

For more details, see [OpenSPP Docker](https://github.com/OpenSPP/openspp-docker) Readme file.
