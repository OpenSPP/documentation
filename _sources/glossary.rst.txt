   Administrator-driven approach for intake and registration (aka supply-driven approach or en masse registration approach)
       Approaches sometimes used to register groups of :term:`household<household>` to be assessed and considered for potential inclusion in one or more programs. Three key features characterize administrator-driven approaches: (1) the impetus for initiating the engagement is driven by administrators, not the people being registered (state ≥ people); (2) :term:`registration<registration>` is usually carried out en masse (groups or cohorts of households); and (3) timing: the timetable for administrator-driven approaches is typically driven by financing and capacity, not by the timing or needs of specific households. See also on-demand approach.

   Appeals
       :term:`grievance<grievance>` about the correctness of decisions made by the programs. It may be a simple administrative error by the program, or involve fundamental issues of :term:`eligibility<eligibility>` and entitlement, which can involve misinterpretation of the law by program; refusal of benefit or service; miscalculation of :term:`entitlements<entitlements>`; or wrong categorization of the potential :term:`beneficiaries<beneficiaries>`.

       | 🇫🇷 Réclamations/plaintes

   Beneficiary operations management
       Stage along the :term:`social protection<social protection>` :term:`delivery chain<delivery chain>` that involves the activity of continuously engaging and collecting :term:`information<information>` from the field or other sources (such as other databases), which is then processed through a set of protocols, recorded, and used to make decisions. This simple pattern of engaging, collecting, processing, and deciding is the common thread that ties together the set of activities that occur continuously in the implementation of a program. :term:`beneficiary<beneficiary>` operations management includes three main functions, which are implemented simultaneously: beneficiary data management, monitoring of :term:`conditionalities<conditionalities>`, and implementation of a mechanism for the redress of :term:`grievance<grievance>`.

It is also a component of the :term:`beneficiary operations management<beneficiary operations management>` system.

Registries that contain information on beneficiaries of multiple programs are known as integrated beneficiary registries.

They may be in the form of :term:`cash transfers<cash transfers>` or in-kind (such as food stamps, food rations, and subsidies). They may be noncontributory :term:`social assistance<social assistance>` programs that are financed by general revenues, or they may be financed by direct contributions as a form of :term:`social insurance<social insurance>`.

   Case management
       The term "case management" is particularly problematic as it is used differently by various professions (for example, by social workers, health care workers, and IT specialists). Further, some may use the term “case management” to mean what we call :term:`beneficiary operations management<beneficiary operations management>`. Some practitioners use the term case management to mean social work (covering awareness, :term:`intermediation<intermediation>`, referrals, and counseling). Others use the term to refer to an integrated approach to managing clients all along the :term:`delivery chain<delivery chain>` (through the entire “life of the case,” as some practitioners call it). To avoid confusion, we avoid the term.

       Mass :term:`registration<registration>` of :term:`household<household>` into the :term:`social registry<social registry>`. With the census sweep approach, all or most households in specific areas (or the entire country) are registered en masse.

   Effectiveness
       It is central to the performance of :term:`delivery systems<delivery systems>`. As defined by the OECD/DAC (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Develelopment/Development Assistance Committee) evaluation criteria, effectiveness is a measure of the extent to which a program or activity attains its objective. In this Sourcebook, an effective system is not only one that reaches, registers, and provides :term:`benefits<benefits>` and :term:`services<services>` to most of the :term:`intended population<intended population>`, but is also a system that is inclusive because it accommodates the specific needs of vulnerable populations and those who face access barriers. Consequently, the evaluation criterion of inclusion is embedded within effectiveness to reflect this logic.

   Efficiency
       Another important dimension of the performance of :term:`delivery systems<delivery systems>`, albeit one that is difficult to measure. Ensuring that outcomes are achieved at reasonable costs, including moving clients through the various phases of the :term:`delivery chain<delivery chain>` at minimal cost in terms of time and money both for administrators and clients, is critical to evaluating performance. Alternative measures of efficiency include processing times for various phases or stages along the delivery chain.

Intermediation connects the demand and supply of social or labor services. The role of the mediator (social caseworker or public employment officer) is to correctly identify the needs of the participant (demand side—through risk screening and profiling) and then to identify the availability of services and service providers (supply side) and then connect them with referrals and counter-referrals (monitoring and follow-up) on the basis of an action plan, protocols, service contracts, and service standards.
