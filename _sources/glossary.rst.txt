   Administrator-driven approach for intake and registration (aka supply-driven approach or en masse registration approach)
       Approaches sometimes used to register groups of households to be assessed and considered for potential inclusion in one or more programs. Three key features characterize administrator-driven approaches: (1) the impetus for initiating the engagement is driven by administrators, not the people being registered (state ≥ people); (2) registration is usually carried out en masse (groups or cohorts of households); and (3) timing: the timetable for administrator-driven approaches is typically driven by financing and capacity, not by the timing or needs of specific households. See also on-demand approach.

   Appeals
       Grievances about the correctness of decisions made by the programs. It may be a simple administrative error by the program, or involve fundamental issues of eligibility and entitlement, which can involve misinterpretation of the law by program; refusal of benefit or service; miscalculation of entitlements; or wrong categorization of the potential beneficiaries.

   Authentication
       Process of establishing confidence that a person is who they claim to be. Digital authentication generally involves a person electronically presenting one or more “authentication factors” to “assert” their identity—that is, to prove that they are the same person to whom the identity or credential was originally issued.

   Beneficiary, beneficiaries
       In the context of social protection, beneficiaries are the individuals or households targeted by a programme to benefit from a transfer. See also: Recipients

       | 🇪🇸 Beneficiario, beneficiarios
       | 🇸🇦 المستفيد، المستفيدين

   Beneficiary operations management
       Stage along the social protection delivery chain that involves the activity of continuously engaging and collecting information from the field or other sources (such as other databases), which is then processed through a set of protocols, recorded, and used to make decisions. This simple pattern of engaging, collecting, processing, and deciding is the common thread that ties together the set of activities that occur continuously in the implementation of a program. Beneficiary operations management includes three main functions, which are implemented simultaneously: beneficiary data management, monitoring of conditionalities, and implementation of a mechanism for the redress of grievances.

       | 🇫🇷 Gestion des opérations des bénéficiaires
       | 🇪🇸 Gestión de las operaciones de los beneficiarios
       | 🇸🇦 إدارة عمليات المستفيدين

   Beneficiary registry
       Database of beneficiaries of a social protection program. It is also a component of the beneficiary operations management system. These beneficiary registries contain information on program beneficiaries. Registries that contain information on beneficiaries of multiple programs are known as integrated beneficiary registries.

       | 🇫🇷 Registre des bénéficiaires
       | 🇪🇸 Registro de beneficiarios
       | 🇸🇦 سجل المستفيدين

   Benefits
       Something tangible that is given by social protection programs to individuals, families, or households. They may be in the form of cash transfers or in-kind (such as food stamps, food rations, and subsidies). They may be noncontributory social assistance programs that are financed by general revenues, or they may be financed by direct contributions as a form of social insurance.

       | 🇪🇸 Biometría o datos biométricos
       | 🇸🇦  القياسات الحيوية/يانات القياس الحيوي

   Biometric identification
       Process of searching against a biometric enrollment database to find and return the biometric reference identifier(s) attributable to a single individual. The comparison may be either a one-to-one (1:1) matching—commonly referred to as “biometric verification”—where comparison is done against a single template, or one-to-many (1:N) matching, where comparison is done against multiple templates.

   Case management
       The term "case management" is particularly problematic as it is used differently by various professions (for example, by social workers, health care workers, and IT specialists). Further, some may use the term “case management” to mean what we call beneficiary operations management. Some practitioners use the term case management to mean social work (covering awareness, intermediation, referrals, and counseling). Others use the term to refer to an integrated approach to managing clients all along the delivery chain (through the entire “life of the case,” as some practitioners call it). To avoid confusion, we avoid the term.

       | 🇫🇷 Gestion des cas
       | 🇪🇸 Gestión social individualizada
       | 🇸🇦 إدارة الحالات

   Census-sweep registration method
       Mass registration of households into the social registry. With the census sweep approach, all or most households in specific areas (or the entire country) are registered en masse. In contrast to the on-demand approach (see below), with the census-sweep approach, enumerator teams go to the communities and conduct intake and registration using door-to-door methods.

   Designated recipient
       The individual in the beneficiary family or household who is designated as the grantee or recipient of benefits when they are paid out (for authentication and payment purposes). A designated recipient should be named for all benefits for which the assistance unit is a group (family or household). A designated recipient may also be needed for individual-based benefits if the beneficiary requires some guardian to act on their behalf (such as with orphans or severely disabled individuals).

       | 🇫🇷 Récipiendaire désigné
       | 🇪🇸 Destinatario designado
       | 🇸🇦 المستلم المعين

   Effectiveness
       It is central to the performance of delivery systems. As defined by the OECD/DAC (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Develelopment/Development Assistance Committee) evaluation criteria, effectiveness is a measure of the extent to which a program or activity attains its objective. In this Sourcebook, an effective system is not only one that reaches, registers, and provides benefits and services to most of the intended population, but is also a system that is inclusive because it accommodates the specific needs of vulnerable populations and those who face access barriers. Consequently, the evaluation criterion of inclusion is embedded within effectiveness to reflect this logic.

       | 🇫🇷 Efficacité
       | 🇪🇸 Eficacia
       | 🇸🇦 فعالية

   Efficiency
       Another important dimension of the performance of delivery systems, albeit one that is difficult to measure. Ensuring that outcomes are achieved at reasonable costs, including moving clients through the various phases of the delivery chain at minimal cost in terms of time and money both for administrators and clients, is critical to evaluating performance. Alternative measures of efficiency include processing times for various phases or stages along the delivery chain.

       | 🇫🇷 Efficience
       | 🇪🇸 Eficiencia
       | 🇸🇦 الكفاءة

   Foundational identification system
       A system for proving (or “authenticating”) an individual’s unique identity. It uses a minimal set of attributes, such as biographic and biometric data, to exclusively describe an individual and, on that basis, to provide government-recognized identity credentials. It is “foundational” relative to various functional systems and databases (e.g., education, health) on which it relies, but it is a parallel and complementary component (along with, for instance, the civil registration system) of the larger ecosystem.

   Hard-to-serve individuals or families
       In general, hard-to-serve individuals or families face multiple risks and constraints, and the complexity that arises with that multiplicity makes it hard to serve them with labor and social services, requiring coordinated or integrated service approaches to help them reduce their social risks and narrow their distance to the labor market.

   Integrated beneficiary registry
       "Integrated beneficiary registries incorporate data from programme beneficiary registries of several different schemes. They provide a consolidated overview of data collected by different programmes, showing “who receives what” benefits (focusing on beneficiaries alone).

   Intermediation
       An integrated service-provision approach used in both labor and social services. Inter- mediation is a service in its own right—and it also con- nects people (workers) to other services. It is the process of informing clients about a range of benefits and ser- vices relevant to their needs, and directing them to the corresponding access point, based on agreed protocols with service provider agencies, sometimes with indi- vidualized action plans (IAPs), to help them overcome multiple socioeconomic barriers. Intermediation con- nects the demand and supply of social or labor services. The role of the mediator (social caseworker or public employment officer) is to correctly identify the needs of the participant (demand side—through risk screen- ing and profiling) and then to identify the availabil- ity of services and service providers (supply side) and then connect them with referrals and counter-referrals (monitoring and follow-up) on the basis of an action plan, protocols, service contracts, and service standards.

   On-demand approach for intake and registration
       Approach that allows anyone to apply and register their information to be considered for potential inclusion in one or more programs. Three key features characterize on-demand approaches: (1) the impetus for initiating the engagement is driven by the clients (not the “state”), who take the initiative to apply; (2) specific clients engage on their own; and (3) timing: with the on-demand approach, specific clients engage in intake and registration on their own timing. While on-demand approaches are driven largely by the way intake and registration is carried out, they also influence other phases of the delivery chain. See also administrator-driven approach.

   One-stop shops/service centers
       One form of “integrated service provision” whereby all services are co-located, so the client needs to go to only one place for support. In some cases, these may be for both labor and social ben- efits and services together. In other cases, they may be for labor services separately (e.g., job centers). Other modal- ities combine social and health benefits and services (such as the “department of health and human services” that is common in the United States and Australia).

       An accounting process that uses two sets of records to ensure figures are correct and in agreement. It confirms whether the money leav- ing an account matches the amount that has been spent and makes sure the two are balanced at the end of the recording period. For cash benefits, recon- ciliation confirms whether the funds transferred to the service provider match the amounts paid out to benefi- ciaries for that implementation cycle, and identifies any amounts not disbursed.

   Performance measurement framework
       Serves three main purposes. First, performance indicators that are monitored regularly can help diagnose bottlenecks in the delivery chain early on and help correct course to prevent systemic challenges. Second, paired with other evaluative techniques, performance indicator frame- works can also help identify alternative channels, pro- cesses, or practices that enable the system to be more effective or save clients time or money. Performance measures of delivery systems can feed into a broader set of evaluative evidence on the program, including impact evaluations, and contribute to a broader learn- ing agenda to refine and improve a program’s impact. Third, a performance measurement system is an important part of a wider oversight function for social protection programs, ensuring that public funds are allocated effectively.

   Proxy means testing
       A tool used to assess a family’s socioeconomic status using a composite measure that calculates a weighted score based on observable house- hold characteristics, such as demographic structures, education levels, location and quality of the household’s dwelling, and ownership of durable goods and other assets. These variables are all considered “proxies” for incomes or consumption, which may be more difficult to measure and observe in situations of high informality.

   Social assistance
       Social safety net programs that are noncontributory transfers in cash or in-kind and are usually targeted to the poor and vulnerable but may also support other groups (such as the long-term unem- ployed, disabled, etc.). Some programs are focused on improving chronic poverty or providing equality of opportunity; others more on protecting families from shocks and longstanding losses they can inflict for the unprotected poor. These programs, also known as social welfare, include cash transfers (conditional and unconditional), in-kind transfers, such as school feeding and targeted food assistance, and near cash benefits such as fee waivers and food vouchers.

   Target group
       refers to the specific segment of the population identified as the primary recipients of social welfare programs and interventions. These groups are usually determined based on certain characteristics or vulnerabilities that make them more in need of support. Understanding and accurately identifying target groups is crucial for the effective design and implementation of social protection policies.

   Targeting
       Targeting in social protection refers to the process or method used to determine which individuals or groups within a population will receive social protection benefits and services. The objective of targeting is to ensure that these resources are allocated efficiently and effectively, reaching those who are most in need. In social protection, targeting is a critical concept, as resources are often limited and the needs are high. Effective targeting can significantly impact the overall success and fairness of social protection programs.
