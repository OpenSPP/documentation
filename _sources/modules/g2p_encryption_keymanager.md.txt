# g2p_encryption_keymanager Module

```{warning}

**Work in Progress**: This document is actively being developed and updated. Content may be incomplete or subject to change.
```

This module extends the functionality of the [g2p_encryption](g2p_encryption) module by providing integration with a Keymanager service for encryption and signing operations. This allows OpenSPP to leverage external key management systems for enhanced security and compliance.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this module is to:

* **Delegate encryption and signing operations to an external Keymanager service:** This offloads the burden of key management from the OpenSPP application to a dedicated, potentially more secure, external service.
* **Provide a configurable interface:** System administrators can configure various parameters of the Keymanager integration, such as API endpoints, authentication credentials, and application-specific identifiers.
* **Seamlessly integrate with the existing encryption framework:**  The module extends the existing encryption provider mechanism in OpenSPP, allowing for easy switching between different encryption providers, including the Keymanager-based provider.

## Functionality

The [g2p_encryption_keymanager](g2p_encryption_keymanager) module provides the following features:

* **Encryption and Decryption using Keymanager:**  The module allows OpenSPP to encrypt and decrypt data using encryption keys managed by the Keymanager service. 
* **JWT Signing and Verification with Keymanager:**  The module enables OpenSPP to digitally sign and verify JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) using the Keymanager service, ensuring authenticity and integrity of sensitive data.
* **Keymanager Authentication and Authorization:**  The module implements secure communication with the Keymanager service using OAuth 2.0 client credentials grant type for authentication and authorization.
* **Configuration Options for Keymanager Integration:** The module provides a user-friendly interface within the OpenSPP settings to configure various aspects of the Keymanager integration, including API endpoints, authentication credentials, and application-specific identifiers for encryption and signing.

## Integration with Other Modules

This module directly interacts with the [g2p_encryption](g2p_encryption) module:

* It inherits and extends the `g2p.encryption.provider` model to include Keymanager-specific configuration fields and methods.
* It provides a new "Keymanager" option for the encryption provider type.
* It overrides the default encryption and signing methods to utilize the Keymanager API when selected.

## Benefits of Using Keymanager Integration

* **Enhanced Security:** Key management is handled by a dedicated service, potentially with stronger security measures than what might be feasible within the OpenSPP application itself.
* **Centralized Key Management:**  Provides a central location for managing encryption keys across different parts of the OpenSPP system or even across multiple applications.
* **Compliance and Auditing:**  Using a dedicated Keymanager service can simplify compliance with data security regulations and facilitate auditing of cryptographic operations. 
* **Scalability and Performance:**  Offloading cryptographic operations to a dedicated service can potentially improve the performance and scalability of the OpenSPP application.
