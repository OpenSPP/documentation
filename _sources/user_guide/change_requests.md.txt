# Change Requests

## Introduction

Change Request Management is a critical component of Dynamic and Adaptive Social Protection programs, which require the ability to make adjustments in real-time to meet the changing needs of beneficiaries. OpenSPP's built-in Change Request Management system allows individuals and groups to request changes to their registration or program participation, such as updates to personal information or changes in eligibility. With OpenSPP's built-in Change Request Management system, program administrators can manage and track change requests in a structured and efficient manner, ensuring that requested changes are validated and processed in a timely manner.

The Change Request Management system in OpenSPP allows for the creation and submission of change requests through an agent interface or a third party app, as well as the validation of requests through a configurable workflow. This ensures that only validated requests are processed, and that the necessary approvals and authorizations are obtained before making any changes to program participation.

In this user guide, we will provide step-by-step instructions on how to use OpenSPP's Change Request Management system. We will cover everything from configuring and customizing the system to meet the needs of your organization, to processing change requests and tracking their status. By the end of this guide, you should have a solid understanding of how Change Request Management can be used to support Dynamic and Adaptive Social Protection programs, and how to leverage OpenSPP's capabilities to achieve these goals.
