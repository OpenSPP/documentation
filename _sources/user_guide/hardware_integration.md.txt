# Hardware integration

## Introduction

Hardware integration is a key feature of OpenSPP, allowing for the integration of hardware devices to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of social protection programs. Currently, OpenSPP supports two types of hardware integrations:

**Document scanner through FTP**: This integration allows for the automated scanning and uploading of documents, such as beneficiary identification documents or proof of income, directly into the OpenSPP platform. This reduces the need for manual data entry and improves the accuracy and timeliness of data.

**ID Document scanner**: This integration enables the scanning and verification of beneficiary identification documents, such as national IDs or passports, using the Thales AT10K scanner. With this integration, program administrators can quickly and easily verify the identity of beneficiaries and ensure that benefits are delivered to the correct individuals.
