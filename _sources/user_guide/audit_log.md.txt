# Audit log

## Introduction

The Audit Log is a powerful tool for tracking user activity and system events in OpenSPP. It records information about who has accessed the system, what actions they performed, and when those actions took place. This information can be used to monitor user activity, detect potential security breaches, and investigate incidents or issues that arise within the system.

It is important to note that the Audit Log is not enabled by default and must be enabled and configured by an administrator. Once enabled, the Audit Log can be customized to record specific events and activities based on the needs of the organization.

While strict access rights are important to ensure that only authorized users have access to data, it is also important to allow users access to enough information to be able to perform their work effectively. The Audit Log can help strike this balance by providing a comprehensive record of user activity without compromising data security.

In this user guide, we will provide step-by-step instructions on how to enable, configure, and use the Audit Log in OpenSPP. We will cover everything from setting up audit policies and filters to reviewing and analyzing audit log data. By the end of this tutorial, you should have a solid understanding of how the Audit Log can be used to monitor and secure your OpenSPP system.
