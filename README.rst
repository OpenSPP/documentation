`OpenSPP` is based on an open-source ERP called `Odoo 15.0 <https://odoo.com/documentation/15.0/>`_. It allows
the project to take advantage of a vast ecosystem of existing integrations and modules.

`OpenSPP` is currently in development, and everything is evolving rapidly as a result of our users' comments.
If you have any questions or needs, please do not hesitate to contact the team through Github
issues or our `Website <https://openspp.org/>`_.
