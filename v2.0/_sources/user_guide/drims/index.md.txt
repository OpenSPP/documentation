# DRIMS User Guide

This guide is for **program staff, warehouse workers, and field officers** who use DRIMS to manage disaster relief supplies.

## What Is DRIMS?

DRIMS (Disaster Response Inventory Management System) helps you track emergency supplies from when they arrive as donations all the way through to distribution to affected communities.

With DRIMS, you can:

- **Record donations** from organizations and track them into your warehouse
- **Request relief supplies** for areas affected by disasters
- **Prepare and dispatch** items from warehouses to distribution points
- **Monitor stock levels** across all your warehouses in real-time
- **Handle returns** when items come back damaged or unused
- **Track everything** by specific disaster incidents

## What You'll Find Here

This guide covers the main tasks you'll do in DRIMS:

- **{doc}`dashboard`** - How to monitor stock levels and alerts
- **{doc}`donations`** - How to receive and process incoming donations
- **{doc}`manage_inventory`** - How to view and manage stock levels
- **{doc}`requests`** - How to submit and approve requests for relief supplies
- **{doc}`dispatches`** - How to prepare shipments and confirm deliveries
- **{doc}`returns`** - How to handle items returned from the field

## Quick Start: Common Tasks

Jump directly to these guides for step-by-step instructions:

## Before You Start

### Permissions You Need

Your administrator assigns you one or more roles in DRIMS. What you can do depends on your role:

| Your Role | What You Can Do |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Viewer** | View all DRIMS information but cannot make changes |
| **Field Officer** | Create requests for your assigned areas and confirm deliveries |
| **Warehouse Staff** | Receive donations, manage stock, and prepare dispatches for your warehouse |
| **Request Approver** | Approve or reject requests for relief supplies |
| **District Coordinator** | Coordinate relief operations in your assigned districts |
| **Manager** | Full access to all DRIMS features and settings |

If you try to do something and see a message saying you don't have permission, contact your system administrator.

### Disaster Incidents

All DRIMS operations are linked to a specific **disaster incident** (for example, "2025 Flooding - Western Region"). Your manager or coordinator creates these incidents when a disaster occurs.

When you create donations, requests, or dispatches, you'll always select which incident they relate to.

## Are You Stuck?

**Can't find the DRIMS menu?**
You may not have DRIMS access. Ask your administrator to assign you a DRIMS role.

**Don't see any warehouses or areas in the dropdown lists?**
Your administrator needs to assign you to specific warehouses or geographic areas. Contact them to request access.

**Need to do something not covered in this guide?**
Ask your supervisor or system administrator for help.
