## Are you stuck?

**Search returns no results?**

- Check your spelling
- Try searching by a different field (name, phone, email)
- Make sure you are searching the right type (Individuals vs Groups)
- The person may not be registered yet

**Cannot find a recently registered person?**

- Check if they were registered under a different name
- Verify the registration was saved successfully

## Next steps

- {doc}`register_group` - Register a new group if not found
