# Vouchers

## Overview

Vouchers and e-vouchers are versatile and effective tools for delivering {term}`social protection` {term}`benefits` to vulnerable populations. By providing {term}`beneficiaries` with a voucher they can use to redeem specific goods or {term}`services`, program administrators can ensure benefits are used appropriately while giving beneficiaries the flexibility to choose the goods or services that best meet their needs.

In OpenSPP, vouchers are a standard feature available to all users. With the platform's built-in voucher management capabilities, program administrators can create, distribute, and track vouchers for various social protection programs.

This tutorial provides step-by-step instructions on how to use vouchers in OpenSPP for social protection programs. It covers setting up voucher parameters and {term}`eligibility criteria`, generating and distributing vouchers, and tracking voucher usage. By the end of this tutorial, you should have a solid understanding of how vouchers can improve social protection programs' {term}`efficiency` and {term}`effectiveness`, and how to use OpenSPP's voucher management capabilities to achieve these goals.
