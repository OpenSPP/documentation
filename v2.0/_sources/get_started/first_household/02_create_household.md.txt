# Step 2: Create a Household

This tutorial is for **users** who want to register a new household in OpenSPP.

## What you'll do

Create a new household (group) record in the registry, entering basic information about the family.

## Before you start

- Complete [Step 1: Access the Registry](01_access_registry.md)
- Log in with a user that has administrator permissions
- Have information about the household to register (name, address, contact details)
- Allow 3-5 minutes to complete this step

## The scenario

The Garcia family has come to your office. You need to create a household record for them before adding individual family members. As a user with administrator priveledge, you can access **Browse All** and see the **New Individual** and **New Group** buttons needed to create registrant records.

## Steps

### 1. Click Browse All

From the Registry Search Portal, click **Browse All** to open the list of registrants where you can create new groups and individuals.
